 Introduction   
his volume contains my doctoral dissertation in philosophy at Northwestern 
University. It was entitled: “ Marxian Hermeneutics and Heideggerian Social Theory: 
Interpreting and Transforming Our World .” The dissertation was defended on May 
8, 1975. 
The original typewritten version was scanned, and an electronic version was created 
on the 25th anniversary of the document. Changes were limited to minor stylistic 
improvements and the graphics. Digital copies are available in html and pdf format 
at: http://GerryStahl.net/publications/dissertations/philosophy .  
Additional graphics were added for the 35th anniversary edition.  
The dissertation considers the two most important philosophers of the modern age. When I was there, Northwestern had the only American department of phi losophy 
that encouraged the study of European philosophy. I also conducted my research during three years in Germany: at Heidelberg, where Heidegger’s work was continued, 
and at Frankfurt, where critical theory extended Marx’ thinking.  
After completing the dissertation, I published two journal articles related to the 
dissertation:  
Stahl, G. (1975). The jargon of authenticity: An introduction to a Marxist 
critique of Heidegger. Boundary 2. III(2), 489 -498. Web: 
http://GerryStahl.net/publications/interpretations/jargon.htm . 
 
Stahl, G. (1976). Attuned to Being: Heideggerian music in technological society. Boundary 2. IV (2), 637 -664. Web: 
http://GerryStahl.net/publications/interpretations/attuned.pdf . 
In 2021, during my retirement, I returned to the themes of these articles and wrote a new presentation of my views:  
Stahl, G. (2021). The working of aural being in electronic music. In C. Rentmeester & J. R. Warren (Eds.), Heidegger and music.  Rowman & Littlefield 
Publishers. Web: http://GerryStahl.net/pub/music.pdf .
 
I have appended this new discussion to my original dissertation because it shows strikingly how the ideas have persisted in my thinking over a period of almost fifty 
years, as well as how they have matured.  This new presentation may be my clearest 
expression of the ideas of my philosophic views in the 1970s.  
During my intervening  academic career , I applied conceptual and methodological 
perspectives from Marx and Heidegger to the theory of CSCL  (computer -supported T 
Marx and Heidegger  
  6 
collaborative learning), developing a theory of “group cognition .” In particular, Marx 
countered the ideology of individualism by analyzing social structures and 
interpersonal interactions at different units of analysis than the individu al person. 
Heidegger also questioned the traditional ontology of natural objects with innate 
attributes by proposing dynamic interactive processes of beings in their ecological 
context.  
Today, the philosophies of Marx and Heidegger are still extremely rele vant— provided 
one adapts them to the current socio- historical context and adjusts each to the implicit 
criticisms of the other —as I tried to indicate in my dissertation .

Abstract 
 
Marxian Hermeneutics and Heideggerian Social Theory:  
Interpreting and Transforming Our  World  
 
Gerry Stahl, 
Northwestern University  
June 1975 
 
 
oday neither philosophy of interpretation (hermeneutics) nor philosophy of 
society can legitimately proceed without the other. Interpretation of the world 
precedes the possi bility of transforming it, according to Martin Heidegger, 
because the pre sence of beings is always already meaning fully structured. For Karl 
Marx, however, interpretations of the world are constituted by human praxis , the 
repro duction and transformation of social reality. The con frontation of Marx’s 
thought with Heidegger’s provides an appropriate historical medium for the 
indispensable task of bringing the problematics of critical social theory and 
philosophical hermeneutics to bear upon each other.  
The alternative notions, that hermeneutics either founds or is founded upon social 
analysis, are reconciled by interpreting Marx’s social methodology as being in accord 
with hermeneutic principles and by transforming Heidegger’s ontology to take 
account of social mediations. Thereby, Heidegger’s critique of metaphysics clarifies 
Marx’s methodological sophistication, rescuing Marxism from a history of 
mechanistic corruptions, while Marx’s insights into the power of social relations provide a corrective to the politically reactionary self -understanding, abstract form, 
scholastic stru cture and non -social content of Heidegger’s jargon.  
Thinking about Marx and Heidegger together is most fruit fully accomplished by a 
sympathetic study of their mature approaches and systems, focusing on the relation between beings and Being, the concrete a nd the abstract, the individual entity and its 
socio -historical context. Hermeneutic, political and internal justifications for the 
selection of specific primary texts, for not making explicit use of secondary works, 
and for interpreting the two philosophe rs through each other’s  eyes are indicated in T 
Marx and Heidegger  
  12 
the introductory Part I. Above all, it is argued, a contemporary perspective on Marx 
is inevitably affected by Heidegger’s influence as well as by intervening political 
developments; and similarly for reading H eidegger.  
Marx’s theory of commodity fetishism plays a role analogous to Heidegger’s theory 
of the oblivion o f Being. In both systems, the distorted appearance of things is related 
to the prevailing form of the Being of beings: their commodity form for Mar x or their 
technological character for Heidegger. The commodity form of products and of 
human productive labor prevails in the bourgeois or capitalist era. Marx, whose 
methodology is specific to an analysis of this period, traces the historical and structu ral 
development of these commodity relations in primarily socio -economic terms. The 
way in which changes in the over -all social character are thereby related to concrete 
interactions provides the guiding theme of the Marx interpretation, which forms Part 
II. 
Where Marx relates the technological character of the commodity to its actual, 
concrete, everyday exchange in the marketplace as historically developed, Heidegger 
insists that the process by which, e.g., the technological character of beings has been 
given, the “Ereignis ,” is ungrounded and incomprehensible. But such an insistence 
ignores the proper position of the Ereignis  within Heidegger’s system: as the process 
of self -mediation and of totalization of all that which is present . The analogy between 
the role of the social character in Marx’s system and that of the Ereignis  in Heidegger’s 
is drawn in the opening and closing remarks of Part III, the Heidegger interpretation. 
There it is argued that Heidegger’s alternative conceptualization weakens Marx’s sense 
of the historical limits of theory as well as foregoing all ability to comprehend transformations of Being or society concretely.  
Considering Heidegger and Marx together suggests that Heidegger’s central fault is in 
failing to relate changes in Being  – the historically prevalent form of presence of 
beings – to developments within the concrete social realm of entities. Changes of 
ontological interpretation can, as Marx demonstrates, be comprehended in terms of 
transformations within society, whereby, of course, the social theory must itself be 
hermeneutically appropriate.

Preface       .        
oday neither philosophy of interpretation (hermeneutics) nor philosophy of 
society can legitimately proceed without the other. Interpretation of the world 
precedes the pos sibility of transforming it, according to Martin Heidegger, 
because the presence of beings is always already meaning fully structured. For Karl 
Marx, however, interpretations of the world are constituted by human praxis , the 
repro duction and transformati on of social reality. The con frontation of Marx’s 
thought with Heidegger’s provides an appropriate historical medium for the indispensable task of bringing the problematics of critical social theory and 
philosophical hermeneutics to bear upon each other.  
The alternative notions, that hermeneutics either founds or is founded upon social 
analysis, are reconciled by interpreting Marx’s social methodology as being in accord 
with hermeneutic principles and by transforming Heidegger’s ontology to take 
account of  social mediations. Thereby, Heidegger’s critique of metaphysics clarifies 
Marx’s methodological sophistication, rescuing Marxism from a history of 
mechanistic corruptions, while Marx’s insights into the power of social relations 
provide a corrective to th e politically reactionary self -understanding, abstract form, 
scholastic structure and non -social content of Heidegger’s jargon. Such a 
consideration of Marx and Heidegger together strengthens the position of each. 
Because they stand firmly within a shared post- Hegelian German tradition, the 
merging of their ideas proceeds by merely drawing out what is already implicitly 
present. 
Thinking about Marx and Heidegger together is most fruit fully accomplished by a 
sympathetic study of their mature approaches and systems, focusing on the relation 
between beings and Being, the concrete and the abstract, the individual entity and its 
socio -historical context. This strategy determines the selection of texts to be analyzed. 
Rather than centering on accidentally paralle l discussions of explicitly political issues, 
writings are chosen with the goal of developing the most important systematic and 
methodological themes of Marx’s and Heidegger’s thought. Their mature 
presentations – Volume I of Das Kapital  (1867) and the lec ture on Time and Being (1962) 
– are taken as standards, with other works drawn upon to trace the developments 
leading up to them. Hermeneutic, political and internal justifications for the selection 
of specific primary texts, for not making explicit use of  secondary works, and for 
interpreting the two philosophers through each other’s  eyes are indicated in the 
introductory Part I. Above all, it is argued, a contemporary perspective on Marx is 
inevitably affected by Heidegger’s influence as well as by intervening political 
developments; and similarly for reading Heidegger.  T

While less central points of direct contact between the writings of Marx and those of 
Heidegger have been ignored, several correspondences have been thematized. A 
primary motivating presupp osition of both Marx’s and Heidegger’s project is the 
belief that true reality lies hidden from our direct perceptions. Marx’s theory of 
commodity fetishism plays a role analogous to Heide gger’s theory of the oblivion of  
Being. In both systems, the distort ed appearance of things is related to the prevailing 
form of the Being of beings: their commodity form for Marx or their technological 
character for Heidegger. Heidegger’s “technological stock” has essentially the same 
characteristics as Marx’s “commodity. ” Both forms are, furthermore, historically 
specific. Technological stock is the characteristic form of the Being of beings in the 
modern epoch, which is, according to Heidegger, historically given by Being -as-such 
or the Ereignis . Correspondingly, for Mar x, the commodity form of products and of 
human productive labor prevails in the bourgeois or capitalist era. Marx, whose 
methodology is specific to an analysis of this period, traces the historical and structural 
development of these commodity relations in primarily socio -economic terms. The 
way in which changes in the over -all social character are thereby related to concrete 
interactions provides the guiding theme of the Marx interpretation, which forms Part 
II. 
Where Marx relates the technological charact er of the commodity to its actual, 
concrete, everyday exchange in the marketplace as historically developed, Heidegger 
insists that the process by which, e.g., the technological character of beings has been 
given, the “Ereignis ,” is ungrounded and incompre hensible. But such an insistence 
ignores the proper position of the Ereignis  within Heidegger’s system: as the process 
of self- mediation and of totalization of all that which is present. To divorce mediation 
from its content is hypostatization; to project social totalization beyond its socio -
historical limits is to fall behind Marx’s level of methodological self -reflection. The 
analogy between the role of the social character in Marx’s system and that of the 
Ereignis  in Heidegger’s is drawn in the opening a nd closing remarks of Part III, the 
Heidegger interpretation. There it is argued that Heidegger’s alternative conceptualization weakens Marx’s sense of the historical limits of theory as well as 
foregoing all ability to comprehend transformations of Being or society concretely.  
Considering Heidegger and Marx together suggests that Heidegger’s central fault is in failing to relate changes in Being – the historically prevalent form of presence of 
beings – to developments within the concrete social realm of en tities. Changes of 
ontological interpretation can, as Marx demonstrates, be comprehended in terms of 
transformations within society, whereby, of course, the social theory must itself be 
hermeneutically appropriate.  
*** 
The methodological reflections on thinking about Marx and Heidegger together, the 
interpretation of Marx, and the analysis of Heidegger are each carried out in three chapters, as summarized below:  
Marx and Heidegger  
  16 
The dialectic of essence and appearance at work in the systems of both Marx an d 
Heidegger represents a shared response to present social appearances as obscuring 
the potential for a better world, one which would incorporate new forms of 
ontological relations (Part I). But the two mainstreams of contemporary continental 
thought which  flow from these systems, and which appeal especially to those 
interested in transforming the world, problematize each other. Issues both internal and external to Marx’s theory and Heidegger’s thought call for a reckoning by each 
with the other (Chapter I) . Heidegger, for instance, accuses Marxism of adopting 
“metaphysical” conceptualizations (Chapter II), while Marxists respond that Heidegger has ignored the impact of social conditions upon his thought (Chapter III).  
Marx’s works are construed as interpret ations of the social relations underlying 
appearances which have been distorted by capitalist relations (Part II). His early 
writings, Alienated Labor and Theses on Feuerbach , anticipations of his mature critique of 
political economy, occasionally substitu te the critical appropriation of prevalent 
metaphysical hypotheses for the stringent methodology subsequently used (Chapter 
IV). Marx’s Grundrisse then develops the appropriate historical analyses, economic 
categories and hermeneutic methodology though the oretical research (Chapter V). 
Finally, Capital  systematically presents the analysis of capitalist society, starting 
dialectically from the abstractions arrived at in the capitalist economy (Chapter VI). 
The hermeneutic accord between Marx’s interpretation s of the world and the historic 
processes which reproduce and transform the world, the manifold unity of Marx’s social theory and capitalist social practice, saves Marx’s system from the charge of 
being metaphysical by deriving its method from its object.  
Heidegger’s post -war thought offers an alternative to Marxism by focusing on the 
general, non- economic relationship between entities and their form of presence in a 
given historical epoch (Part III). The Origin  of the Work  of Art presents Heidegger’s 
“reversal” toward Being -as-such, formulating his central question of Being in terms 
of the origin of the historically specific form of presence of a work which establishes its own presence (Chapter VII). The tendency here to give an absolute priority to 
Being develops in the essay The Thing, which introduces his mature theoretical 
framework. (Chapter VIII). Heidegger’s final statement, the lecture on Time and Being, 
takes a meta- ontological overview of the history of the forms of presence which, 
however, leaves the concrete details of historical ontological transformations 
shrouded in mystery (Chapter IX). Thereby, the ontological self -interpretation of the 
world is illegitimately divorced from its ontic self -transformation, leaving Heidegger’s 
social commentary content -less and messianic next to Marx’s.

The present work represents the culmination or thirty years of progress toward the 
author’s intellectual maturity. As such, it is a token of gratitude to all those who have 
contributed, however unknowingly, to that process. It is, accordingly, dedicated to those 
magical moments when truth makes its appearance unannounced, but deservedly, within a social gathering.

PART I: INTERPRETING MARX 
AND HEIDEGGER IN OUR WORLD

Marx and Heidegger

Chapter I. The Alternative of Marx 
and Heidegger  
he reasons for my decision to write on Karl Marx and Martin Heidegger 
together are numerous. Throughout my study of philosophy, the two major 
tendencies in continen tal thought, Marxism and existentialism,  have been 
rivals for my interest. Marx and Heidegger are clearly the founders of the two schools and to my mind they remain the most profound representatives. It was thus natural 
that I should take the opportunity of researching a dissertation to come to grips with 
the philosophical alternative they present.  
My personal inclination is not, however, merely subjective; it is an expression of the 
objective conditions in society and in the philosophical tradition. There are, that is, 
good reasons for someone c ritical of today’s society to be repelled by the inherent 
conservatism of Anglo -American philosophy and to be attracted to Marx and 
Heidegger. Both Marx and Heidegger, for all their criticisms of Hegel, retain the 
central insight of dialectics: that the fa cts are not simply given, but are mediated in 
ways that can only be comprehended with the help of theory. A philosophy that does 
not take this seriously is ill equipped to deal with deceptive reality.  
To turn to Marx or Heidegger as to a dogma is, however,  to destroy them. Not only 
does the originality of their thought demand an intellectual struggle that critically 
overcomes the habits of common sense, but the weaknesses which have become 
apparent in their systems necessitate creative development of these systems. Internal 
requirements of the two philosophies, as well as their deficiencies, call for a 
confrontation between them, which could serve to clarify and strengthen each of the alternatives, if not to synthesize them. The present introductory chapter and the 
subsequent review of previous debates between the two positions outline these needs, 
anticipating the material which follows in the actual interpretations.  
A basis for comparison of the two approaches exists in terms of the common search 
for essences hidden in appearances. The differences between the essential concepts 
they form and emphasize suggest, then, that Heidegger can be understood as a 
rethinking of Marx, who too narrowly based his analysis on the economic realm. On 
the other hand, the lac k of historical content in Heidegger’s concepts needs to be 
remedied through a study of Marx’s method of historically specific  concept 
formation. Although a review of previous attempts at interpreting Marx and Heidegger from each other’s perspective reveal s that there has been little success to 
date in this enterprise, previous misunderstandings can generally be attributed to T 
Marx and Heidegger  
  20 
national and international politics, and it can be hoped that a more fruitful dialogue is 
now possible.  
Chapter I concludes with a s ummary of the themes and considerations which are 
raised in Part I and which determine the outlines of the subsequent interpretations of 
Marx and Heidegger. Chapters II and III expand upon the comparison of Marx and 
Heidegger by reviewing Heidegger’s criti que of Marx and Adorno’s Marxist critique 
of Heidegger. These chapters thereby uncover internal arguments why Heidegger should have paid more attention to Marx and why Marxists must come to terms with 
Heidegger’s thought.  
Interpretation for Transformation  
There is today a need for interpretation of the world. Marx and Heidegger share with 
Freud the belief that it is possible with the help of a theory to understand someone’s 
ideas, behavior and self better than he understands them himself. The motivations 
consciously debated by the agent may well be screens against true perception or at 
best interpretations of his situation, which are not necessarily privileged over the analysis of his situation by other people. The idealistic presupposition of the 
transparency of the cogito to the ego has been rejected by these post -Hegelian outlooks. 
The subject, who has been raised in a family, mediated by social conditions, and 
“thrown” into the world, must interpret his own consciousness, activity, and Being 
just as an o bserver must, namely from a perspective which may well be more limited 
by ignorance of various factors and by being more caught up in self -concealing 
conditions than an observer with a developed theory – even though the subject has 
been exposed to more of the empirical facts. This is not a merely scholastic question 
of epistemology. The self -perception of the subject situated naturally (i.e., without the 
objectifying alienation of theoretical analysis) in his family, society and world is in fact subject to systematic distortions of which he remains unaware. The normal psychic 
dynamic of family life is predicated upon its sublimation into the unconscious; the 
invisible hand of bourgeois exchange society could not be effective without 
commodity fetishism; and the reliability of the world presupposes that we are “fallen” 
in it and do not recognize its “worldhood” or “worlding,” its Being.  
Both Marx and Heidegger situate Hegel’s dialectic of essence and appearance in the 
contemporary world. Marx argues that capit alist society is pervaded by a “fetishism 
of commodities,” that is, that the essential social relationships which structure society 
and the lives of its members appear, if at all, in the illusory form of characteristics of 
physical objects, of the commodit ies produced. Any evaluation of capitalist society in 
terms of its appearances alone, without the assistance of a theory which interprets and demystifies the appearances will necessarily be apologetic – at most liberally reformist 
Marx and Heidegger  
  21 
– covertly and dogmatical ly endorsing the mystifying ideology of capitalism. A 
theoretical interpretation of the essences as illusion, on the other hand, allows for a 
critical grasp of their contradictory nature and reveals potentials for qualitative 
transformation.  
Similarly, Heidegger argues that Western thought is guilty of a progressive 
“forgetfulness of Being” such that the ontological categories through which we 
understand reality distort our relationships to ourselves and other beings. What is 
needed is a meta -ontology, a theory which deals with the deceptive character of 
contemporary appearances. Thus, common to Marx and Heidegger, but not to the competing philosophic approaches of the twentieth century, is the belief that 
appearances by themselves are illusory , the insight that this illusory character is 
historically situated, and the conviction that philosophy’s task is to break through such 
illusion. This shared conviction provides a basis for the following interpretations of 
Marx and Heidegger and for their comparison. The central methodological problem 
for both thinkers is accordingly the question of how to derive the appropriate theoretical essence from the given appearances, from the ideologies and the 
phenomena. The different approaches to a shared projec t determine contrasts 
between Marx and Heidegger, which are clear in their respective conceptual frameworks, or rather, in the way in which they try to avoid imposing 
conceptualizations external to their subject matter.  
Marx and Heidegger each formulate an  essential concept. Marx raises the question, 
What is truth? by arguing that capitalist appearances are illusory, fetishized, false. This 
alone might qualify him for consideration as a philosopher in the broad sense of a 
thinker who stops at no academic bo rders. Frequently, however, he is relegated to the 
ranks of out -moded economists. Worse yet, perhaps, his thought is accepted as 
interdisciplinary, and segmented according to the academic division of labor against 
which it stands as a forceful counterexample. A preferable way of understanding the 
complexity of Marx’s thought is suggested by Jürgen Habermas’ analysis of 
emancipatory  science as a dialectical unity of interpretive and explanatory  interests.

Speculative philosophy (of the Hegelian tradition) is concerned to interpret reality, to 
provide categories for subsuming reality such that the system of categories provides 
a sense or meaning in terms of which reality can be understood, comprehended, 
interpreted. Such philosophy is retrospective , not pred ictive; it does not make 
calculations, but interprets the significance of their results. Non -dialectical philosophy 
and science are explanatory  in the sense that they construct their concepts operationally, 
formulate laws to predict in quantitative terms, clarify logical difficulties and

anomalies. They are thus useful for manipulating events within the given norms, but 
inadequate by themselves f or criticizing these norms. Because Marx wants both to 
comprehend reality critically and to explain its functioning and its development with 
an eye to trans forming it, his theory must be both interpretive and explanatory.  
To understand Marx is to comprehe nd the unity of these two aspects of his work. 
Nevertheless, one can roughly say that Marx’s theory of value (in Capital , Volume I) 
is primarily interpretive (of the essence), while his price theory ( Capital , Volume III) 
is primarily explanatory (of the ap pearance). We shall be concerned with Marx’s 
interpretive framework, rather than with his explanatory science. The criticisms which 
the technical details of the latter have received by even Marx’s most sympathetic 
readers is not the least reason for recons idering Marx’s interpretive theory in relation 
to present society and in comparison to competing philosophies. The mediation of 
Marx’s value theory with his price theory – which gives the unity of interests to his 
critical theory of society – takes place i n terms of the consideration of more and more 
economic influences. The starting point for the entire system is the commodity , 
cornerstone of capitalist production. The theory of capitalist society, including the analysis of fetishism, which is the basis of  the critical thrust of Marx’s system, can be 
presented by unpacking this abstract concept. For Marx’s concept of the commodity summarizes the results of years of social research and theoretical critique which he 
dedicated to developing his early, anticipa tory social criticisms.  
Despite the fact that many social critics today feel that Marx’s systematic focus was 
too narrowly economic, surprisingly few alternatives to Marx’s approach have been 
developed. Either Marx’s theory is patched up or research into d elimited realms of 
appearance is carried out with little theoretical guidance. Martin Heidegger’s thought 
suggests itself as a broader alternative to Marxism. His philosophical theory is not 
only prima  facie comparable to Marx’s, but in many respects metho dologically quite 
similar. Furthermore, there are historical reasons for viewing this alternative as a 
rethinking of Marxism. Heidegger’s mature thought can well be understood as the 
attempt to interpret reality, including its illusory character, more radi cally than Marx 
by reflecting upon the ontological categories at work in capitalist production and more generally in our modern age. In his theory, the concept of technological  Being plays 
roughly the same role as that of the commodity in Marx’s. Two cruci al questions in 
evaluating Heidegger’s alternative to Marx are: Has Heidegger really thought about 
Marx adequately, that is, has he understood the significance of Marx’s accomplish -
ments? Secondly, has Heidegger really been more radical than Marx or has he  in fact 
fallen behind Marx’s standpoint philosophically as well as in terms of content? These 
questions are to be understood quite apart from the undisputed fact that Heidegger’s 
theory is not as fully developed in concrete details as Marx’s, that Heidegg er has, by 
his own admission, just managed to clear the ground somewhat.  
The concepts of a critical theory of society are perforce radically historical. They 
display a temporal structure all their own. If the given appearances are illusory, then 
Marx and Heidegger  
  23 
the concep ts that name them effectively must be able to move dialectically between 
essence and appearance. In temporal terms, the concept must show that appearances 
lack necessity, that the past was essentially different. As critical, the concept also 
proclaims the possibility of a better future; it anticipates a qualitative transformation.  
Marx’s key concept, that of the commodity, is not limited to the era which it 
characterizes. Nor is it simply universal. Rather, it can retrospectively shed light on its 
less deve loped forms under feudalism and also suggest the form it might take in a 
subsequent harmonious industrial society. Briefly, that is, the relation between the two primary moments of the commodity, use value and exchange value, mirrors the 
historically chang ing tensions within society as a whole, their relation of opposition 
within the capitalist form of production had not yet developed before capitalism and 
would have to be overcome in the future in order to transcend fetishism, alienation, 
exploitation, and  impoverishment. Within Heidegger’s system, much the same can be 
said about the technological character of  Being. In his terms, it is the “Janus head” 
facing both danger and salvation, one foot in the present epoch and another in a 
possible subsequent one.  Retrospectively, it also makes sense of the development that 
led up to it. 
For a theory to move between essence and appearance, to interpret the development 
up to the present and to uncover potentials for the future in the present, its key 
concepts must b e neither operationally defined in terms of the given nor ahistorically 
general. This accounts for the extensive concern with history evident in the work of both Marx and Heidegger. That Heidegger’s concepts often seem to lack the historical 
content charac teristic of Marx’s suggests that a comparison of the two philosophies 
may help remove Heidegger’s greatest weakness. 
Interpreting Marx and Heidegger Together  
The problematics of Marx and Heidegger are comparable in fundamental ways. 
Central to both are the  twin paradoxes: guided by theory, the analyses must 
nevertheless be immanent to their object; consciously situated in the world they 
interpret, their task is to transform it through critique . The unity of critical theory and 
situated immanence common to M arx and Heidegger defines the tangential point of 
ideology critique and destructive hermeneutics, social theory and social praxis , 
interpretation and transformation of the world.  
Marx and Heidegger follow a theoretical approach by focusing on an essential  category. 
This essence, which is elaborated into a conceptual framework, is not simply a concept 
from which one could logically or dialectically deduce a system, nor does it represent 
some one being which grounds all other beings as God did in medieval th eologies. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  24 
The theoretical approach is a consequence of the claim that the true structure of reality 
has been obscured. That this claim does not itself lead to mysticism is due to its being 
situated in the character of capitalist commodity relations or tech nological Being. Marx 
and Heidegger see the root of obfuscation in historical developments and strive for 
the removal of the prevalent deception rather than for submission to it or exploitation 
of it for purposes of domination. Recognizing the historical o bjectivity of false 
appearances, they view their own theoretical insights as moments in the historical transformation required to remove the deceptive character of reality’s contemporary 
self-interpretation. This sense of historical objectivity distinguish es Marx and 
Heidegger from vulgar utopianism which dreams up ideal societies without concern 
for making the transition from today’s problems. Yet the two thinkers are critical in 
the sense of orienting their thought toward a qualitatively different future.  As situated, 
their theoretical and critical approach is immanent. Their orientation toward the future 
is based on their position in the present, which they understand as having developed out of the past. The character of the systems of Marx and Heidegger,  including their 
methodologies, is explicitly immanent to their historical situation. The theories are articulations of their own circumstances, rather than attempts to impose an abstract, 
unrelated, ahistorical conceptual framework upon the given. The giv en is criticized in 
accordance with its own claims.  
However, despite these at least formal similarities, Marx and Heidegger have generally 
been considered to be at loggerheads . Followers of Marx and Heidegger have 
maintained primarily polemical relations w ith each other , and previous attempts to 
think about Marx and Heidegger together have been problematic at best. Since the 
publication of Heidegger’s Being and Time, Marxists have dealt with Heidegger in 
basically two ways. Some, like the early Marcuse or t he late Sartre, sought in 
Heidegger’s approach a new ontological foundation or philosophy of man to 
supplement the analyses of a Marx who supposedly had little time for epistemological 
questions. Others, like Lukacs, lumped Heidegger’s writings in with bis tro 
existentialism and rejected the whole as bourgeois ideology. Generally, the polemicists have been quick to attack surface features without understanding their role in a system 
that admittedly was until recently only available in the form of obscure hin ts. 
Heidegger’s apologists, at the other extreme, try to remove all danger of criticism by insisting that he must be interpreted – an endless and thankless task – before he can 
be judged.  
Commentators who have focused on Heidegger’s later works have freque ntly 
expressed the feeling that Heidegger’s thought, for all its depth and breadth, is in the 
end somehow empty. However, when not hurtled as a weapon of polemic, this 
objection generally appears camouflaged in the guise of a personal aside tacked onto 
the end of an objectively argued, uncritical exposition with no attempt to explain the 
emptiness in terms of what was analyzed. How does this emptiness arise from Heidegger’s approach? Where can the problem be pinpointed in his system? What are 
the ideologica l implications? What remains of value? The answers to these questions 
Marx and Heidegger  
  25 
must be sought in the innermost recesses of Heidegger’s system. Such a search differs 
as much from the last minute posing of general “critical” doubts at the end of an 
uncritical analysi s as from an emotional response to surface features. The massive 
secondary literature on Heidegger seems to lack such a critical search of his system, judging its claim to relevance on the basis of its underlying outlines.  
The two knowledgeable attempts to  deal with Heidegger as a social thinker fail not 
only in their over -zealous defense and acceptance of Heidegger’s pronouncements, 
but, more seriously, in seeking something that is not there, Heidegger’s “political 
philosophy” in the Aristo telian sense. O tto Pöggeler’s Philosophie  und Politik  bei 
Heidegger  
2 – apparently an attempt to deal with the basic critical problem avoided in 
his larger commentary on Der Denkweg  Martin  Heideggers  – collects many of the central 
issues and provides a counter -balance to the polemics, without, unfortunately, finding 
time to go beyond making plausible his defenses of Heidegger. He emphasizes the 
problem of developing a “political philosophy” on a Heideggerian foundation, 
without trying to understand how H eidegger’s approach already represents an 
alternative to Marxism.  
Alexander Schwan, in his Politische  Philosophie  im Denken  Heideggers ,3 tries to adapt 
Heidegger’s analysis of the ontological structure of the work of art simplist ically to an 
analysis of the Hitler state, rather than seeing the art analysis as itself already a social 
analysis. The arbitrary nature of Schwan’s approach becomes striking when he repeats 
the adaptation with a very different later Heideggerian model with almost identical 
result s. An alternative approach to an analysis of the relation of politics to Heidegger’s 
thought suggests itself in the material on the 1930’s which Schwan has himself assembled: to trace the effects of the political climate upon Heidegger’s writings or to 
oppose an analysis of the political phenomena to Heidegger’s conception of history 
– lines of politically critical analysis which are, unfortunately, absent from the political 
philosophizings of Pöggeler and Schwan.  
While few have succeeded in relating Heideg ger to Marx, there is an increasing 
tendency to focus on his similarities to Hegel. Heidegger himself has become more 
concerned with Hegel in his later writings and seminars, although even Being and Time 
discussed Hegel’s conception of time at some length.  Heidegger, however, intends to 
go beyond the tradition that stretched from Plato to Hegel. Hence Kierkegaard, 
Nietzsche and Marx, the great Hegel critics, are important to him. The concern with 
Kierkegaard, who allegedly remained on an ontic level, dimini shed after Being and Time, 
while Nietzsche assumed a central importance in Heidegger’s work. After his 
fascination with Nietzsche waned, Heidegger seems increasingly to have recognized

Marx and Heidegger  
  26 
the importance of Marx’s post -Hegelianism, without, however, dealing in  any depth 
with Marx. Rather, Heidegger’ s references to Marx suggest that a discussion between 
them is one of the great unfinished tasks of Heidegger’s project. An analysis of these 
references indicates, further, that a necessary first step is to correct the 
misunderstandings that they express.  
The work of Theodor W. Adorno contains a serious and extended critique of 
Heidegger’s system. However, Adorno avoids a treatment of Heidegger’s philosophy 
in isolation. For him, as a Marxist, it is important to deal  with Heidegger the way Marx 
dealt with Hegel: as an expression of the latest stage in the history of philosophy and society. Heidegger’s popularity is to be understood in social terms and its ideological 
consequences are to be combated. Consequently, Ador no’s analysis is difficult to 
judge on a purely philosophical level. Further, while it makes several fundamental 
points, its form of presentation suffers from abstractness: distance from the material. 
Not only is the Marxist alternative to Heidegger kept o n an implicit level; the 
interpretation of Heidegger’s system remains itself between the lines. Only when supplemented by a thorough interpretation of Marx and Heidegger can Adorno’s 
claims be evaluated, demonstrated, criticized or expanded upon. Particula rly 
bothersome in Adorno’s discussions is the way in which he ranges across Heidegger’s writings without admitting that they have developed under the recognition of many 
of the same immanent criticisms which Adorno articulates. Thus, it is useful to focus 
on one stage of Heidegger’s path of thought – his final system – in order to determine 
just which of Adorno’s accusations hold in the end. 
The Hermeneutic Context  
Heidegger’s attitude toward Marx suggests that he has rather uncritically accepted 
certain pr evailing reduc tionist interpretations of Marx’s writings and has thereby 
reinforced their popularity (cf. Chapter II below). Soviet orthodoxy has not only 
reified Marx’s critical, dialectical thought into a metaphysics, but has used it as a 
justification for totalitarianism. In rejecting Soviet Diamat, Heidegger (at least until 
after the war) thinks he is dispensing with Marx, thereby accepting orthodoxy’s false claim to authenticity while ignoring what truth may yet be contained in its system. 
Here, as elsewhere, Heidegger’s jargon of origin -al thinking comes into conflict with 
his insight into the need for “destructive’ thought, which starts out from available philosophies to uncover what truth is buried within them. Thus, Heidegger makes a 
blanket reject ion of the economism of Marx as seen through the eyes of the old left 
(Marxist -Leninists and Social Democrats alike) without considering Marx’s arguments 
for the primacy of commodity production in interpreting our world and, thereby, 
without being able to up-date the theory to more contemporary needs. Because he 
Marx and Heidegger  
  27 
does not see the mediation of Marx’s economic studies with his philosophy (i.e., his 
explanatory with his interpretive theory), Heidegger is forced to an extreme humanist 
interpretation when he want s to salvage something of Marx’s thought. By focusing 
his attention exclusively on Marx’s early work as divorced from Capital , Heidegger 
inevitably arrives at the kind of humanist or even existentialist picture of Marx which 
is so popular in liberal theological circles and which allows him to reject Marx as 
metaphysically humanist.  
In opposition to Heidegger’s emphases, the following interpretation of Marx (in Part 
II) attempts to make sense of his thought as a whole precisely by steering clear of 
possible metaphysical, economist and humanist distortions in order to arrive at a 
position that can speak to Heidegger with strength, relevance and indepen dence. 
Within the context of a presentation of the core of Marx’s system, focus will be on Marx’s principle o f the primacy of commodity production, the unity of his social 
theory and capitalist social practice, and his analysis of fetishism. It is hoped that the discussion of these focal points will contribute to thought on these important matters. 
Although the v iew of Marx presented is conceived as a synthesis of contemporary 
independent Marxist exegesis, the attempt to structure an interpretation of Marx in 
terms of the confrontation with Heidegger is, it seems to me, unique and fruitful.  
The interpretation of H eidegger (in Part III) follows similar guidelines. The manifold 
debates over existen tialism and Marxism are indicative of the tact that Marxists almost 
always consider Heidegger an existentialist That is, Heidegger’s doctrine of man in his 
Daseins analytik  is interpreted moralistically, or at least is taken as an end in itself, as a 
subjectivistic, individualistic philosophy, rather than as a first step in the anti -
subjectivistic questioning of Being. This understanding of Heidegger has not led to 
significa nt results because, I suspect, the “existentialism” in Being and Time is a popular, 
superficial level of meaning which merely obscures Heidegger’s own thought as 
developed in his later writings. Adorno’s critique is, I think, convincing in arguing that 
the appealing elements of Heidegger’s  magnum opus are jargonistic and wholly 
inconsonant with Marxist concerns. The following interpretation thus turns to the late Heidegger, where the accent is no longer on the individual, avoiding, however, 
the theological interpretation to which Heidegger’s ambiguity carefully leaves itself 
open. 
Seen in relation to Marxism, Heidegger’s final system seems to call for the comparison 
with Marx’s and it is, indeed, surprising that so little has been done along these lines. 
The important influences of Heidegger on Marxism tend to be highly indirect: e.g., 
through the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans -Georg Gadamer and within the 
context of French structuralism. By contrast, the interpretation presented here aims 
at confronting  Heidegger’s mature thought head -on with a viable reading of Marx. 
The central themes will accordingly be: Heidegger’s claim for a priority of Being, his doctrine of the forgetfulness of Being and the structure and methodology of his 
critical meta -ontology  – especially the relation of its concepts to history. The basic 
Marx and Heidegger  
  28 
analysis of Heidegger’s system attempts to capture what seems to be obviously at 
work in Heidegger’s writings since the mid -thirties in line with reflections which 
Heidegger himself makes in his latest work. The danger is, of course, that any such 
over- all sketch is reductive of Heidegger’s thought, whose importance lies more in its 
concrete suggestions and specific points then in its general outlines – witness the 
above reference to hermeneut ics and structuralism. If, however, this interpretation 
lacks the profundity that alone can benefit from Heidegger, at least it consciously 
avoids the shortcomings of previous interpretive attempts and clears the way for 
further work by establishing a context within which the confrontation between Marx 
and Heidegger can meaningfully be developed. Although placed within a critical 
argument, the interpretation of Heidegger, like that of Marx, aims at sympathetic 
understanding and constructive development.  
The problem with previous interpretations of Marx (including Heidegger’s) and of 
Heidegger (including those by Marxists) can be summed up in one objection: they 
impose a preconception upon their object. This is precisely what phenomenology, 
with its slogan: “Zur Sache  selbst,” rebelled against. Heidegger has adopted this ethos 
in demanding that Being -itself be thought about “appropriately.” Appropriate 
thought appropriates its object in an appropriate way, in a manner derived from the 
thing itself. Marxism, t oo, in line with its rejection of ideology, is opposed to criticism 
from an external standpoint; Marx’s “immanent critiques” of Hegel, political 
economy and bourgeois ideology in general set out from the presuppositions of the 
questionable theory itself in  order to show its contradictions and inadequacies.  
To understand Marx and Heidegger appropriately, to uncover what is unique and original to each, means to follow their own hermeneutic principles. In comparing the 
two systems, neither can be subordinated to the other or to some supposedly 
objective third standpoint of commonsensical analysis. The principle guiding the 
present work has been to allow the two systems to unfold themselves autonomously, 
understanding the tangential points as organic parts of th eir respective contexts. This 
has been sought through keeping the two presentations distinct rather than comparing them point by point. The systems are developed through close textual analysis of key 
works, which, however, are selected with an eye to the comparison. Further, the 
confrontation is not externally imposed; it arises immanently out of the present crisis 
of Marxist theory and the contra dictions of Heidegger’s thought as well as out of the 
internal demands of the two systems. Once the Marx interp retation has been spelled 
out, the points of comparison can be developed in terms of the material as it occurs 
in the course of the Heidegger presentation, thereby strengthening the focus of the 
Heidegger interp retation without distorting it. 
Just as, for  Marx, immanent critique need not become apologetic if it retains its critical 
thrust, so, for Heidegger, what is decisive is not to avoid the hermeneutic circle but 
to come into it in the right way: “Our first, last and constant task is never to allow our  
fore-having, fore -sight and fore -conception to be presented to us by fancies and 
Marx and Heidegger  
  29 
popular conceptions, but rather to make the scientific theme secure by working out 
these fore -structures in terms of the things themselves.” 4 
As this quotation from Heidegger notes, it is not merely one’s project and an 
anticipation of the results which form preconditions of understanding, but one’s 
preconceptions as well. If one is to avoid external critique which is inappropriate, 
distorts and  misses the point, then account must be taken of the source of 
preconceptions, the Wirkungsgeschichte  of the work under consideration.5 Only through 
the history of its effects, its tradition of having been variously construed, does a work 
cross the gap between the author and the reader. The history of ideas is thus the 
medium which permits understanding, the reconciliation of the dead spi rit in language 
with that spirit which forces it to life on the basis of its afterlife.  
But intellectual history takes place in the context of socio -political developments. 
Heideggerian hermeneutics may be correct when it argues that society can only be 
known through linguistic texts: “Language is the house of Being” and conversely 
“Being, which can be understood, is language.”6 Thus, it is true that Marx focuses on 
Hegel’s texts, the tomes of bourgeois political economy and British governmental 
reports. M ore generally, “society” is to be located only in its citizens, that is, in their 
(fundamentally linguistic) objectifications in self -reflection, speech, documents, works 
and institutions. Marxism none -the-less has the last word when it points out that the  
subjects have already been thoroughly mediated, so that the social superstructure 
created by their activity is, through them, already (pre -linguistically) shaped by the 
character of the social totality. Karl -Otto Apel is thus right to point to the basis i n the 
“community of interpreters” for the ontological categories, whose history Heidegger 
leaves to a linguistic world -spirit whose theological overtones have merely been 
modernized and whose substance has accordingly been diminished.7 However, in

5 This notion of the importance of the historical effects of a text on the subsequent 
comprehension of that text is developed in Hans -Georg Gadamer, Wahrheit  und 
Methode:  Grundzüge einer philosophischen Hermeneutik  (1960; 2nd ed. Tubingen: Mohr, 
1965).

demonstrating Apel’s role as innovative interpreter of both Heide gger and Marxism.

  30 
abstrac ting from the historically -specific to formulate the ideal of a speech 
community, Apel is himself in danger of abstracting from the social context of the 
communicating subjects: their relations within a specific, concrete , historical form of 
production.  
A merger is necessary between the hermeneutic insight into the context -dependence 
of all understanding and the ideology -critical emphasis on societal mediat ions. From 
his early analysis of  Being- in-the-world as the essential structure of human existence, 
Heidegger has stressed the importance of the world around a being to the character 
of the being itself: a tool has meaning within a technical context, a jug within the relationships of the physical world, a bridge within lived space and a word within the 
communicative situation. The grand question of Being is ultimately an investigation 
of the contextuality of beings. But Heidegger fails to recognize the power of social 
formations to define the context of beings; here Marxism furnishes the antidote. With 
Marx,  social theory supplies  the comprehension of the context. A Marxist appropriation of 
Heidegger’s critique of non -contextual, “metaphysical” positivism would 
simultaneously clarify Marxism’s own approach and demystify Heidegger’s content -
poor ontological mu sings. For Marx and his creative followers have articulated 
numerous ways in which the power of the context to structure the beings it contains 
is itself created by those beings. Such analyses are, however, readily subject to 
misunderstandings unless they  are formulated within a theory which explicitly rejects 
mechanistic, positivistic, idealistic and subjectivistic philosophical stances. To bring out those fundamental theoretical features of Marx’s thought which are especially 
important today requires a p eculiarly twentieth century formulation which would 
make explicit how social facts are comprehended within a social theory and how the 
categories and orientation of that theory are related to its social context.  
Because the essence of man inheres in the ne xus of social relations from the viewpoint 
of social theory, human activity constitutes social praxis , the process of the production 
and reproduction of the form and substance of society. The task of socially -conscious 
theory is accordingly to interpret so cial phenomena, as human artifacts and, as such, 
as the expression of social relations among people. The reconstruction of the pre -
conditions of the given social reality should ideally demonstrate the mediations that 
constitute its history. This demonstrat ion is neither a recounting of empirical history, 
a logical argument unrelated to the specifics of the case, nor a causal account of events and effects. Rather, it points to ways in which the phenomena have been conditioned, 
have been characterized by soci al conditions such that in the end the social origins

Suhrkamp, 1971).  
Marx and Heidegger  
  31 
have become obscured. Political events, for instance, function as both symptoms and 
screens for social transformations.  
Outside the political arena of the past century, divorced from the Russian and Chi nese 
revolutions, the failure of revolution in the West, the rise of fascism, the devel opment 
of advanced industrial economies and culture, Marx cannot today be understood. For it is in terms of such events and what underlies them that the Leninist, Stali nist, 
Maoist, existentialist and humanist interpretations arose.  
A contemporary understanding of Marx must take into account these events, the 
social relations behind them and the resultant interpretations if it is to comprehend 
its own procedure, possibil ities and necessity. The situation with respect to 
understanding Heidegger is, if slightly less complex, not as different as might be 
assumed. What is particularly clear in Capital  holds for Heidegger’s writings and his 
references to Marx as well: namely, the philosophical argument is inextricable from 
timely observations and social considerations. This relates as much to the perspective 
of the reader as to that of the authors.  
It is precisely our temporal distance from the concerns of the past decades whic h 
makes the following interpretations possible. Until recently, the hermeneutic goal of 
under standing the author better than he understood himself has been hindered by 
politics. In their concern to battle socialism and Stalinism, the Heideggerians ignored  
or distorted the thought of the man the Soviets claimed as a founding father. Similarly, 
Marxists felt compelled to attack and ridicule the thought of a philosopher who had 
consorted with fascism, and here the “existentialist” themes seemed most vulnerabl e. 
This is not to imply that the problems underlying the old politics and polemics have vanished nor that exegesis must or can completely disavow politics. But philosophy 
today is in a period of retrenchment, where hasty formulations prove ineffectual; 
serious interpretation of Marx and Heidegger is presently underway throughout the 
world. This has opened the possibility of a successful confrontation of their respective 
systems, already implicit in the convergence of approaches and concerns in the 
respectiv e philosophical camps. The political changes are, of course, related to social 
conditions which are more difficult to evaluate. Suffice it to say that developments in the consciousness of youth throughout the world in the past decade suggest progress 
in the conditions of the possibility of a new epoch in both Marx’s and Heidegger’s 
terms. If this is so, then the Marxian and Heideggerian systems have gained in 
relevance, and that means in accessibility and compara bility. 
The point of new interpretations of Marx and Heidegger is not to rewrite Capital  and 
Being and Time as though sub specie eternitatis; rather, each age – every decade, class and 
country – requires its own understanding, incorporating both changes in the social 
fabric and consequent modifications in revolutionary perspectives. That the American 
New Left considered Capital  irrelevant is understandable; whatever unfortunate 
consequences it may have had, this attitude allowed for a freshness, creativity and experi mentation which may not only have  been its greatest virtue, but its only 
Marx and Heidegger  
  32 
objective potential. The 1970’s, however, call for a synthesis of the best in the old and 
new leftovers. The following is not the required reformulation of Marx and 
Heidegger, but understands itself as a faltering st ep in the task of clarification, analysis 
and interpretation which recognizes itself to be politically, historically and 
philosophically situated. This means that perspectives which may well be appropriate 
in Eastern Europe, Italy or China are here rejected. Not unrelated to the concern with 
the situation of advanced industrial society, the insights of Theodor W. Adorno have 
guided the whole of the dissertation. Acknowledgment is made therefore by quoting 
Walter Benjamin, Adorno’s guru, whose ephemeral and contradictory character may 
provide an appropriate symbol for the iconoclastic attitude of the so -called Frankfurt 
School. 
In line with their tentative character, the following presentations can be taken as 
theses on reading Marx and Heidegger today, worki ng hypotheses for future inquiry. 
Accordingly, the thought of Marx and Heidegger, which is conceived of as systematic, as well as the debates between them are presented in terms of their development. 
Rather than starting with texts which represent mature s tatements of the systems, the 
analyses unfold in chronological order, even if the continuity and teleology of thought is often stressed over the deviations. Not the least motivation for this procedure is 
the suspicion that the System has become an anachron ism. Where systematic 
presentations tend to petrify into monuments, an approach which follows the 
research which spirals in on a system makes more sense pedagogically and critically, 
for it stresses the arguments and aporia . Nevertheless, the mature works of Marx and 
Heidegger assume a priority in the interpretation of their early works, which are grasped as the seeds of the later thought and thus as inadequate articulations of that 
which they intend.

Chapter II. Heidegger’s Critique of 
Marx  
Being and Time (1927) made its appearance between two of the most important Marxist 
publications since Capital  (1867), namely Georg Lukacs’ History  and Class Consciousness  
(1923) and Marx’s 1844 Economic -Philosophic Manuscripts  (first published in 1932). It is 
perhaps le ss arbitrary to place Heidegger in this context than might be assumed, 
Heidegger formulates both the historical motivation for the analyses in Being and Time 
and the task which remains at its end in terms of the concept of “reification of 
consciousness,” the category central to the philosophically most important essay in 
Lukacs’ book and later made popular by the discussion of’ “alienation” in Marx’s 
Manuscrip ts.  
Although Heidegger never wrote extensively on Marx or explicitly referred to Lukacs, 
those references to Marx which he does make assign him a surprisingly central 
position within the field of Heidegger’s concerns, Significantly, the dozen references 
to Marx’s thought which occur in Heidegger’s later writings deal exclusively with 
Marx’s early manuscript and the Theses on Feuerbach  of a year later. A review of 
Heidegger’s comments on Marx in terms of their misunderstandings as well as their 
insights raises the suspicion that Heidegger’s familiarity with Marx is limited to a 
superficial reading of these early writings, an attempt to dismiss Lukacs’ philosophy 
as insufficiently radical (in the philosophical sense), a sympathy for conservative social 
critic ism and even an openness to propagandistic anti -communism. This impression 
is, of course at odds with Heidegger’s carefully cultured reputation as a thorough historian of philosophy, a discoverer of what has remained implicit in what is said and 
a thinker of Being whose inspirations are above merely empirical, political influences.  
In view of the importance Heidegger quietly attributes to Marx’s thought, one is forced to wonder why he never dealt with Marx in anything like the way he delved 
into Nietzsche. The suspicion that this represents an important failing in Heidegger’s 
work is a central motivation of the present comparison of Marx and Heidegger. In order to orient this study on the central issues and to incorporate what thinking 
Heidegge r has devoted to the question of  his relation to Marx, it is useful to consider 
hints Heidegger has, almost parenthetically, sprinkled through his writings. This chapter shall, therefore, review all his published references to Marx, Marxism and 
materialism.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  34 
Heidegger’s Early Criticisms 
To begin with, it is interesting to note what Being and Time had to say about the 
Lukacsian phrase, “reification of consciousness.” There are three passages to 
consider. At the very start of Being and Time, where Heidegger is motivating th e 
investigation of his fundamental ontology of Dasein  (human Being), he argues that 
even the analysis of reified consciousness, no matter how critical it may be of the 
present human condition, still assumes uncritically the traditional concept of 
subjectiv ity as a standard:  
Ontologically , every idea of a ‘subject’ – unless refined by a previous 
ontological determination of its basic character – still posits the 
subjectum (hypokeimenon ) along with it, no matter how vigorous one’s 
ontical protestations against the ‘soul substance’ or the ‘reification of 
consciousness.’ Thinghood itself which such reification implies must 
have its ontological origin demonstrated if we are to be in a position 
to ask what we are to understand positively  when we think of the 
nonre ified Being of the subject, the soul, the consciousness, the spirit, 
the person.8 
Where Lukacs’ analyses reified consciousness from within a problematized 
subject/object metaphysics (unlike Marx, as Heidegger fails to see), Heidegger sets 
out from the phe nomenon of reified consciousness (formalized in the new 
terminology as inauthentic Dasein ) in order to get at the essence behind this 
appearance. By raising the transcendental question of the conditions of the possibility 
of reification or inauthenticity, Heidegger hopes to arrive at a non -dogmatic 
conception of authenticity. The dialectic between the abstract value of capitalist commodities and their concrete use value, which is at the base of Lukacs’ analysis of 
reification, is cast in the aura of a radic al ontological investigation in terms of 
presence -at-hand and readiness- to-hand. Heidegger’s originality here lies in his 
relating ontological categories to temporal structures – to human temporality in Being 
and Time.  
Toward the end of his major work, Hei degger indicates that his analysis of temporality 
is intended to show the superiority of his analysis of presence- at-hand over Lukacs’ 
treatment of reification:  
 
8 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, p. 72, S. 46.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  35 
If world -time thus belongs to the temporalizing of temporality, then 
it can neither be v iolated  ‘subjectivistically’ nor  ‘reified’ by a vicious 
‘objectification .’9 
If the last part of this sentence is, indeed, aimed at Lukacs, it does the depth of Lukacs’ 
analysis little justice. Lukacs in fact gave a coherent argument to show how human 
“temporaliz ing” was historically transformed into “world- time” due to social changes 
related to the transformation from the feudal to the capitalist mode of production. Lukacs’ eminently Marxian analysis suggests a mediating link between changes in 
ontological categ ories and societal developments, precisely the type of connection 
that is missing in Heidegger’s entire path of thought. Further Lukacs quotes Marx as 
having in 1847 (in The Poverty  of Philosophy) already noted the reification of qualitative 
temporality in to the quantitative measurement of time as a consequence of the 
mechanization of production.  
In the end, it is unclear just how Heidegger’s analysis of the relationship between reification and temporality is supposed to be superior to Lukacs’. On the final  page 
of Being and Time, Heidegger calls his accomplish ments merely the “point of 
departure” and indicates that all of the crucial questions about reification remain to 
be settled:  
The distinction between the Being of existing Dasein  and the Being 
of being which does not have the character of Dasein  may appear 
very illuminating: but it is still only the point of departure for the 
ontological problematic; it is nothing with which phil osophy may 
tranquilize itself. It has long been known that ancient ontology works with ‘thing -concepts’ and that there is a danger of ‘reifying 
consciousness.’ But what does this reifying signify? Where does it arise? Why does Being get ‘conceived’ ‘proxim ally’ in terms of the 
present -at-hand and not in terms of the ready -to-hand, which indeed 
lies even closer? Why does this reifying always keep coming back to 
power? How is the Being of ‘consciousness’ positively  structured such 
that reification remains ina ppropriate to it? Is the ‘distinction’ 
between ‘consciousness’ and ‘thing’ sufficient for tackling the 
ontological problematic in a primordial manner? Do the answers to 
these questions lie along our way? And can the answer even be sought  
as long as the question of the meaning of Being remains unformulated 
and unclarified?

Marx and Heidegger  
  36 
There is an ambiguity to Heidegger’s relationship to Lukacs, which foreshadows his 
later attitude to Marx. It is not clear whether Heidegger – who claims his analysis is 
more fundamental than Marxism – wishes to reject the thought of Lukacs and Marx 
or uno btrusively to translate it into a new conceptualization. While the question is 
basically a matter of degree, the opposed strivings do both seem to be at work in 
Heidegger’s writings. Whatever the intention of Heidegger’s references to Lukacs, 
they clearly present two characteristics of his approach which are opposed to Marxism 
and which Adorno singles out for criticism: the attempt to push all questions back to a fundamental  question and the search for positive structures to replace Marxism’s 
negative, but therefore critical, analyses.  
Political Distortions  
In the context of Heidegger’s life’s work, Being and Time represents the starting point 
of his research, of his path of thought. But much of its approach was later rejected. 
During the 1930’s Heidegger re versed his opinion concerning the “ Sache  des Denkens,” 
the essential theoretical question which was to stand at the head of his system. From 
a concern with the temporality of the individual, Heidegger turned to a meditation on 
that which assures philosophy  a possible history, i.e., on the conditions of the possibility 
of an epochal (historical) structure to the ontological presuppositions that characterize 
the presence of beings. The first major public presentation of this new problematic 
was Heidegger’s Letter on Humanism , which took the occasion of a disagreement with 
Sartre to unfold Heidegger’s own position. Considering the extensive and important discussion of Marx in this essay, it can well be considered an attempt to present 
Heidegger’s thought as an alternative to Marxism rather than to existentialism.  
Gajo Petrovic, who analyzes Heidegger’s comments on Marx in his article on “Der 
Spruch des Heideggers,” argues that Heidegger has merely indicated a basis for 
discussion between the two viewpoints, but has declined to proceed to the 
comparison.
11 Thus, Heidegger has pointed to two aspects of Marx’s thought which 
make it important to the Heideggerian project: the concept of alienation and the recognition of the historical in Being. However, according to P etrovic, Heidegger has 
failed in his understanding of Marx to recognize the unity of the latter’s thought and, relatedly, to comprehend it in its full originality. In assuming that Marx’s approach is 
metaphysically humanistic, Heidegger consistently misint erprets it, fitting it neatly into 
the history of metaphysics without considering what is unique to Marx, and 
consequently failing to learn from him or even to join in a fruitful conversation with

him. To correct the shortcomings of Heidegger’s attempt at comparing his own 
thought with Marx’s requires an interpretation of the core of each system in terms of 
its respective originality. This has been attempted in the following parts of the present 
work. The results reached there are here antic ipated in order to review and evaluate 
Heidegger’s understanding of Marx.  
It is important first of all to note the developmental character of Heidegger’s 
conscious, or at least published, relationship to Marx. Being and Time and the other 
early writings never mention Mar xism despite its extraordinary significance in the 
intellectual atmosphere of a seemingly pre- revolutionary Germany – at most a facile 
dig is made at Lukacs. In the war years, when Heidegger was meditating upon spirit, 
art and Nietzsche in an attempt to re but Nazi ideology, he identified Marxism with 
the mechanistic simplifications of crude Diamat (Marxism -Leninism), rather than 
trying to develop a humane and critical Marxism as did other independent thinkers – 
Adorno and Merleau -Ponty, for instance. For He idegger, Marxism is viewed as just 
as much of the social problem as fascism: 
The spirit falsified into intelligence thus falls to the role of a tool in the service of others, a tool the manipulation of which can be taught 
and learned. Whether this use of intelligence relates to the reg ulation 
and domination of the material conditions of production (as in 
Marxism) or in general to the intelligent ordering and explanation of 
everything that is present and already posited at any time (as in 
positivism), or wh ether it is applied to the organization and 
regulation of the mass and race of a folk, in any case the spirit as 
intelligence becomes the impotent superstructure of something else, 
which, because it is without spirit or even opposed to the spirit, is 
taken for the authentic reality. If the spirit is taken as intelligence, as 
is done in the most extreme form of (by?) Marxism, . . . (1935)
12 
There is no attempt made here to distinguish what is of value in Marx’s thought from its vulgar distortion. Around 1940, when he was engaged in a monumental task of 
interpreting Nietzsche in explicit opposition to the prevailing interpretation by the Nazis, Heidegger still seems to have uncritically accepted the Nazi view of Marx as a 
political ideologue with no  philosophical originality to offer.  
That the medieval theologians study Plato and Aristotle in their own 
way, i.e., giving them a new meaning, is the same as that Karl Marx 
used Hegel’s metaphysics for his own political world -view. (1940)

Not until the Letter  on Humanism  is Marx taken as a serious thinker.  
But whence and how is the essence of man determined? Marx 
demands that the ‘human man’ be known and acknowledged. He 
finds this man in ‘society’. The ‘social’ man is for him the ‘natural’ 
man. In ‘soci ety’ the ‘nature’ of man, which means all of his ‘natural 
needs’ (food, clothing, reproduction, economic sufficiency), is 
equally secured. (1946)14 
Even here, Heidegger’s pronouncements are problematic, as Petrovic points out. 
Heidegger puts Marx’s key ter ms in quotation marks to indicate that they are 
questionable without bothering to question what Marx meant by them. There is no 
recognition on Heidegger’s part that Marx uses the adjectives “human,” “social” or 
“natural” in a critical way: as dialectically  opposed to “alienated.” On the contrary, 
Heidegger implies that the use of these terms makes Marx into a traditional, 
metaphysical humanist, a writer who merely accepts the dogmatic view of humanity 
as having a fixed essence. That Marx developed his conce pts through a critique  of 
Hegelian metaphysics – a specific negation, not a simple inversion – suggests that 
Marx may have escaped the metaphysical position, particularly in his mature works 
where the Hegelian terms rarely appear even in their critical for m. Further, the 
concern with securing economic sufficiency is so reductive of Marx’s thought that it 
is more appropriate to that non -Marxian, non- philosophical “materialism” Heidegger 
refers to elsewhere.15 But such “materialism,” the greed for material go ods as opposed 
to the higher “values,” is unrelated to Marx except as ignorant caricature.  
The next mention of Marx puts him in good company in Heidegger’s scenario: right 
along with Nietzsche:  
Absolute metaphysics belongs with its inversions by Marx and Nietzsche to the history of the truth of Being. (1946)

This evaluation of Marx is repeated in later years without further explanation:  
But in what does the telos consist, the consummation of modern 
philosophy, if we may speak of such? In Hegel or not unti l

Schelling’s late philosophy? And how about Marx and Nietzsche? 
(1955)17 
And again:  
Marx and Nietzsche are the greatest Hegelians . . ..  The 
consummation is only as the total process of the history of 
philosophy, in which process the beginning remains as e ssential as 
the consummation: Hegel and the Greeks. (1958)18 
While Heidegger spent several years and over a thousand published pages to explain 
how Nietzsche had inverted the metaphysics which held sway from Plato’s Republic  to 
Hegel’s Logic and Schelling’ s essay on human freedom, he has not dedicated a single 
phrase to the possibility that Marx’s Capital  might have left that tradition behind – as 
Heidegger’s own Verwindung  followed his Überwindung of metaphysics. Having 
struggled so hard to learn from the example of Nietzsche’s failure to transcend 
metaphysics, Heidegger seems to have avoided raising the question whether Marx 
might have something positive to contribute. It seems that Heidegger’s political 
conservatism and his flirtations with an existential ist jargon led him to ignore Marx in 
favor of Nietzsche until his own thought had really developed and he could see the parallels with Marx. Not only would an earlier study of Marx have saved Heidegger 
from traveling down some dark dead- end trails (“ Holzwe ge,” as he calls them), but a 
more profound understanding of Marx might still help to fill in some content in the emptiness of Heidegger’s concepts.  
Heidegger suggests that a productive discussion with Marxism would focus on the 
related terms “alienation” and “homelessness,” both understood in relation to an 
essential dimension of history – not psychologically. The key to the analysis would be 
a consideration of the essence of technology. Through an understanding of the 
essence of technology, one could disc over why today everything appears as the 
material of labor.  
Homelessness becomes a world destiny. It is, therefore, necessary to think of this destiny from the point of view of the history of Being. 
What Marx, deriving from Hegel, recognized in an essentia l and 
significant sense as the alienation of man, reaches roots back into the homelessness of modern man. This is evoked – from the destiny or 
Being – in the form of metaphysics, strengthened by it and at the 
same time covered by it in its character as hom elessness. Because

Marx and Heidegger  
  40 
Marx, in discovering this alienation, reaches into an essential 
dimension of history, the Marxist view of history excels all other 
history. Because, however, neither Husserl nor, as far as I can see, 
Sartre recognizes the essentially his torical character of Being, neither 
phenomenology nor existentialism can penetrate that dimension within which a productive discussion with Marxism is alone possible.  
For this it is necessary to liberate oneself from the naive conceptions 
of materialism and from the cheap, supposedly effective, refutations 
of it. The essence of materialism does not consist of the assertion that everything is merely matter, but rather of a metaphysical 
determination according to which all beings appear as the m aterial 
of labor. The modern metaphysical essence of labor is antic ipated in 
Hegel’s Phenomenology  of Spirit as the self -establishing process of 
unconditional production; i.e., the objectification of the actual 
through man experienced as subjectivity. The  essence of materialism 
is concealed in the essence of technology, about which, indeed, a great deal is written, but little is thought. Technology in its essence 
is a destiny (in the history of Being) of the truth of Being resting in 
forgetfulness. (1946)
19 
Until one associates the term “materialism” with Marx as a dialectical materialist, what 
Heidegger says is fine. But Heidegger clearly does make this identification, thinking 
he is saving Marx’s philosophy from interpretations that are even more naive.  
It is crucial to show that Marx does not simply posit all beings as material of labor 
and nothing more, for it is this supposed assumption which makes Marx a 
metaphysical thinker in Heidegger’s eyes, relating him to both Hegel and Nietzsche. 
This metaphysic al position is appropri ately attributed to Ernst Junger’s non -Marxian 
book, Der Arbeiter , which Heidegger carefully studied, but not to Marx’s writings.20 
 
19 “Letter on humanism,” p. 209, S. 170.  
20 Ernst Jünger, Der Arbeiter: Herrschaft und Gestalt  (Hamburg, 1932). Heidegger praises 
this book for having “achieved a description of European nih ilism in its phase after 
World War I” and for making “the ‘total work character’ of all reality visible from the 
figure of the worker.” He characterizes it as “a clear -sighted book” which 
understandably “was being watched and was finally forbidden” by the Nazis. Cf. 
Martin Heidegger, The Question of Being  (bilingual ed., New Haven: College & 
University Press, 1958), p. 40ff. Herbert Marcuse (Herbert Marcuse, “The affirmative 
character of culture,” Negations . Boston: Beacon Press, 1969, p. 128) presents a 
different evaluation of Jünger’s book, viewing it as part of the ideological preparations 
for German fascism in the 1930’s:  
Marx and Heidegger  
  41 
Even within the labor process, Marx distinguishes between that moment of an object 
which is mere grist for the mills of capitalist industry and that indissoluble kernel of 
nature which is in principle out of humanity’s reach.21 In Capital  it is only as ab stract 
exchange value, not as concrete use value, that the commodity corresponds to what 
Heidegger has in mind as material of labor. Further, abstract value does not represent 
a metaphysical assumption on the part of Marx; he understands it as an historica l 
appearance, a fetish, which reaches its extreme form in automation. Marx’s concept remains critical of the present metaphysical character of beings as commodities in 
terms of both a pre -capitalist past and a projected future. Marx’s epochs and their 
political content may not correspond exactly to Heidegger’s scheme, but surely the 
two share a critical distance from the contemporary “metaphysical determination” 
which Heidegger attributes to the essence of materialism. The reduction of nature to 
material for labor is, in Marx’s account, a social product, not the result of his or 
Hegel’s autonomous speculation. Marx’s “materialism” consists precisely in the thesis 
of the primacy of societal mediations in determining ontological categories: the very 
principle Heidegger repeatedly overlooks in his interpretation of Marx and 
consistently lacks in his own thought.  
In later comments, Heidegger rather flippantly casts Marx aside, but only to underline 
the crucial question underlying his attempt to provide an alterna tive to Marxism: What 
is the heart of the matter, the essence which must determine the path for critical 
thought today? In the process, Heidegger suggests that Marx failed through too great 
an eagerness for action:  
None of us know what craft modern man mus t engage in in the 
technical world, must engage in even if he is not a worker in the 
sense of a worker on the machine. Even Hegel, even Marx could not 
yet know this and ask this, because even their thought still had to 
move in the shadow of the essence of technology, which is why they 
never freed themselves to think about this essence adequately. No 
 
The cynical suggestions offered by Jünger are vague and restricted primarily 
to art. ‘Just as the victor writes history, i.e., create s his myths, so he decides 
what is to count as art.’ Even art must enter the service of national defense 
and of labor and military discipline. (Jünger mentions city planning: the 
dismemberment of large city blocks in order to disperse the masses in the event of war and revolution, the military organization of the countryside, 
and so forth.) Insofar as such culture aims at the enrichment, beautification 
and security of the authoritarian state, it is marked by its social function of 
organizing the whole society in the interest of a few economically powerful groups and the hangers on.  
21 The indissoluble kernel has been likened to the Kantian Ding -an-sich – transformed 
from the realm of conception to that of labor – by Alfred Schmidt in his Marx’s Concept 
of Nat ure (London: New Left Books, 1972).  
Marx and Heidegger  
  42 
matter how important the socio -economic, the political, the moral, 
even the religious questions may be, which are handled in relation to 
the technical craft, no ne of them reach at all in the yet unthought 
essence of the manner in which everything is at all which stands 
under the domination of the essence of technology. This has 
remained unthought because the will to act, i.e., to make and cause, 
has crushed thoug ht. (1952)22 
Further: 
However, the transformation of the world so considered requires first that thought change, just as behind this (Marx’s) demand a 
transformation of thought already stands. (Cf. Marx, Theses on 
Feuerbach , 11) But in what manner should t hought change itself if it 
does not set itself on the path into that which is worthy of thought? 
(1962)
23 
Heidegger is justly well -known for his quietism, his contemplative stance of letting 
Being be. Insofar as this is not merely a way of making a methodo logical demand 
similar to that of descriptive phenomenology, it may be understandable as a political 
judgment in times very different from Marx’s. After all, on the one hand Heidegger 
enthusiastically jumped on the bandwagon of activism in the early 1930’s  and it is 
understandable that he would seek to avoid that error being repeated. On the other 
hand, the example of Adorno shows that even a Marxist may have to argue against 
prevalent forms of activism and resign himself to contemplation as a result of the  
political climate.  
Marx’s point – according to his eleventh thesis which Heidegger insists on not 
understanding despite his adherence to it – is that philosophical interpretation must 
not be an end in itself, but must be part of a hermeneutic circle which  includes the 
anticipation of a transformed world, thereby intervening critically in the given reality. 
However, there is something to Heidegger’s argument. Marx’s activism is related to 
his view of the centrality of the socio -economic, the political quest ions, answers to 
which demand conscious human action.  
Heidegger’s alternative, that the essential question is the question of Being, does not 
so obviously involve political action, but seems to belong more to the contemplative 
realm of the study of philoso phy. Nevertheless, Heidegger opens the Letter  on 
Humanism  with the statement that, “Our thinking about the essence of action is still 
far from resolute enough,” suggesting that thinking about Being may also be a form

Marx and Heidegger  
  43 
of social action. For Marxists, it is clear that ontological reflection is not divorced 
from social practice, for better or worse. Again, the problem of activism and quietism 
in Marxism and Heidegger may be helped to its resolution through the discussion 
between them.  
Heidegger’s Mature Critici sms 
In the mature statement of his system, the essay Time and Being (1962), Heidegger does 
not list Marx’s “metaphysics” next to Nietzsche’s in the history of philosophy; he 
entirely ignores Marx. However, in subsequent reflections on the relation of his own 
thought to other recent philosophers or to the task of thought today, Heidegger is still very much concerned with Marx. In the following passage he still views Marx as 
metaphysically grounding the way things are in the “dialectical mediation of the 
movement of the historical process of production.”  
Metaphysics thinks about beings in the manner of representational 
thinking which grounds (with reasons). For since the beginning of 
philosophy and, with that beginning, the Being of beings has shown 
itself as  the ground ( arche, aition , principle). The ground is that from 
which beings as such are what they are and how they are in their 
becoming, perishing and persisting as knowable, manipulated, 
worked. As the ground, Being brings beings to their respective 
presencing. The ground shows itself as presence. The present of 
presence consists in the fact that it brings what is present each in its own way to presence. In accordance with the kind of presence, the 
ground has the character of grounding as the ontic causa tion of the 
real, as the transcendental makin g possible of the objectivity of  
objects, as the dialectical mediation of the movement of the absolute 
spirit, of the historical process of production, as the will to power 
positing values. What characterizes me taphysical thinking, which 
grounds the ground for beings, is that metaphysical thinking, starting from what is present, represents this in its presence and thus presents 
it in terms of its ground, as something grounded. (1964)

Philosophie und die Aufgabe des Denkens,” Zur Sache des Denkens (Tübingen: 
Niemeyer, 1969), S. 62.

  44 
There is something to this:  it recognizes the historical dimension of Marx’s analysis, 
and it is true that for Marx the character of beings is dependent upon the predominant 
conditions of production in society. Further, Marx some times suggests that all history 
can be viewed in thes e terms – this outlook has subsequently been systematized under 
the name historical materialism and turned into a truly metaphysical dogma.  
However, Marx can at least also be interpreted as arguing that the primacy of 
commodity production –  as the essential  category of social analysis, rather than simply 
as one precondition  of social existence – is itself historically- specific; that this primacy 
is part of the problem with capitalism; and that this primacy must itself be explained, 
i.e., taken as a symptom.  This latter view of Marx is part of a more sophisticated 
understanding of his methodology, one which places him in close proximity to 
Heidegger. When incorporated into the comparison of Marx and Heidegger, this 
interpretation not only speaks to the inhere nt needs of Heideggerian theory, but 
benefits from the confrontation itself in terms of problematizing its foundations. For, as the last quotations suggest, Heidegger’s main claim is that he is being 
philosophically more radical ( ursprünglich ) than Marx. A Marxist can argue that it is not 
the “final questions” which are important – even assuming they make sense or can be 
answered – but those more modest questions which are abstract enough to make 
possible a critical theory, but specific enough to be useful.  Both Marx and Adorno, 
for instance, make this reasonable point. Yet, Heidegger’s challenge here is more 
specific: does Marx’s thought “represent” beings as “grounded” in a way which 
Heidegger avoids?  
Heidegger’s claim rests upon the assumption that Marx s imply reversed traditional 
philosophy, retaining its unfortunate habit of grounding all beings in some particular, 
higher being:  
Throughout the whole history of philosophy, Plato’s thinking 
remains decisive in changing forms. Metaphysics is Platonism. 
Nietzsche characterizes his philosophy as reversed Platonism. With the reversal of metaphysics, which was already accomplished by Karl 
Marx, the most extreme possibility of philosophy is attained. It has 
entered its end. (1964)
25 
Heidegger would  have us believe that Marx transformed representing, grounding 
metaphysics into empirical science (political economy, sociology, political science, 
anthropology), which grounds everything in a preconceived notion of its object: man 
or society. We have alre ady indicated that this is a distorted view of Marx’s dialectical, 
critical, emancipatory “science.” Even if Heidegger can get away with claiming that 
“normal” science (research within a paradigm) does not think, i.e., does not question 
its foundations, which cannot be extended to Marx, no matter how often Marx used 
 
25 Ibid., p. 57, S. 63.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  45 
the term “science” or how much content his concepts articulate, for he rejects the 
need for foundations a la fundamental ontology. Calculative thinking adds richness to 
Marx’s thought, for it informs his conceptual framework rather than presupposing it; 
his empirical research is dialectically intertwined with its own guiding theory as 
expressed in the systematic presentation.  
Heidegger’s final reference to Marx, in a 1969 television broadcast, in dicates three 
further criticisms:  
(1) Talk of society is metaphysical because society is posited as an absolute 
(unconditioned) subject (agent).  
 (2) Marx is involved in “representing” the world, which, according to Heidegger’s 
essay on the “Age of the Wor ld-view,” involves grounding the world in the 
interpreting subject. 
 (3) Marxism remains philosophically within the subject/object relation and therefore 
cannot grasp the essence of technology.  
 (Professor Heidegger, . . . Do you see a social mandate for 
philosophy?)  
No. One cannot speak of a social mandate in this sense. If one wants 
to answer this question, one must first ask: “What is society?” and 
must then reflect that today’s society is just the absolutizing of 
modern subjectivity and that from this perspective a philosophy 
which has overcome the standpoint of subject ivity cannot enter the 
discussion. Another question is, to what extent one can speak of a transformation  of society. The question about the demand to 
transform the world leads to a much -quoted sentence by Karl Marx 
in the Theses on Feuerbach . I would like to cite it exactly and read it: 
“The philosophers have merely interpreted the world differently; the 
important thing is to transform  it.” In citing this sentence and in 
following this sentence, one ignores the fact that a transformation of 
the world presup poses a change of the representation of the world and 
that a representation of the world can only be won when one interprets  
the world sufficiently.  
That is, Marx bases himself on a certain interpretation of the world in order to demand its “transformation ,” and thereby we can see that 
this sentence is unfounded. It gives the impression of speaking decisively against philosophy, although in the second part of the sen -
tence the demand for philosophy is silently presupposed . . .. I see, 
however, in the essenc e of technology the first glimpse of a much 
deeper secret, which I name the Ereignis , the event of appropriation 
– from which you can gather that there can be no question of a 
Marx and Heidegger  
  46 
resistance to or a negative judgment of tech nology. Rather, it is 
important to understand the essence of technology and the technical 
world. It seems to me that that cannot occur as long as one remains 
philosophically within the subject/object relation. That is, the essence 
of technology cannot be understood on the basis of Marxism. (1969)
26 
 (1) Heidegger implies that Marx conceived of society as the collective will of free 
subjectivities who had but to agree upon change for it to be accomplished. While 
Heidegger may have attributed this view to Marx on the basis of reading Lukacs, i t is 
an unacceptable interpretation. For Marx, society is not a being, capitalism is not a 
thing; Marx’s analysis aims precisely at dispelling such fetishisms. This naive view of 
society as absolute subject seems much more to underlie Heidegger’s own enthu siasm 
for the Hitler state’s act of taking its destiny into its own hands, as expressed in Heidegger’s 1933 Rektoratsrede . It is precisely such a voluntaristic conception of society 
that Marx attacked in his arguments with liberalism, utopianism, anarchism  and vulgar 
socialism. Far from calling for an arbitrary transformation of society, which would 
create a new social formation ex nihilo or by subjective will power, Marx developed a 
theory incorporating a strong sense of social destiny. Revolutionary freed om 
consisted, for him, primarily in the recognition and comprehension of the pervasive 
power of prevailing social relations and productive forces to define potentials and 
limitations within society and to condition any attempt at social transformations or 
conservations. The task of the revolutionary subject is thus given by his objective 
contexts to encourage the existing liberatory tendencies and possibilities while 
resisting the forces of reaction and repression. Perhaps the charge of absolute subject -
ivity is more plausibly directed against the process of production in Marx’s account than against his concept of society as such. The outlines of the development of the 
modes of production – Asiatic, classical, feudal, capitalist, socialist – may give the 
appearance of an autonomous process of self -negation on the Hegelian model. 
However, the historical details in any of Marx’s extended presentations – i.e., in The 
German Ideology , “Forms which Precede Capitalist Production” and Capital , versus the 
popular sum maries in the “Preface” to Towards  a Critique  of Political  Economy  or in the 
Communist  Manifesto  – stress the interplay of the various kinds of objective conditions, 
geography, trade, politics, economic determinants, cultural biases, etc. Further, where 
the mode of production develops in conjunction with another factor – the 
establishment of a moneta ry system or the growth of scientific knowledge, for 
instance – neither is simply founded in the other; rather, Marx shows how they 
support each other dialectically as mutual preconditions.  
 (2) Heidegger’s claim that Marx’s representation of the world gro unds the world in 
the interpreting subject is questionable on two counts. It has already been suggested 
 
26 Martin Heidegger im Gespräch  (Freiburg: Alber, 1969), S. 68f, 73f.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  47 
that Marx’s method consists in an interplay between research and systematic 
presentation. That means that the resulting representation of the world is d erived 
from the reality which it “articulates”  in the double sense of structuring and 
verbalizing. Secondly, for Marx, theories of society – including those ideologies which 
form the object of much of his research, as well as his own writings – cannot be 
divorced from the society they mirror. Thus,  even if Marx’s representation of the 
world were shown to be grounded in his subjectivity, this is itself mediated through 
and through by objectivity and knows itself to be. 
 (3) Also problematic is Heidegger’s co ndemnation of Marx’s understanding of 
technology as remaining philo sophically within the subject/object relation. It is by no 
means clear that one can ignore the subject/object dichotomy as simply as Heidegger 
has attempted. Hegel had already taken the al ternative approach in trying to reconcile 
subject and object in the historical process of their dialectical development. Marx criticized Hegel’s result as idealistic, arguing that the dichotomy had a basis in social 
reality and could therefore only be reso lved through a transformation of the form of 
social relations. In the case of the subject/object relation, as in that of the essence/appearance distinction and the view of nature as material for labor, the 
factors in Marx’s system are not dogmatic postulat es to be discarded lightly, but 
aspects of reality under the constraints of the capitalist system. When Marx refers to 
the subject/object relation in his investigation of technology, it is not as a 
metaphysical principle of his system, but a part of the id eology that he is subjecting 
to immanent critique. Marx’s own theory of technology is based on his theory of 
surplus value, which is not directly related to a subject/object problematic.  
This is where Heidegger’s published position on Marx stands at the pr esent and where 
it is likely to remain standing as far as Heidegger is personally concerned. These few 
explicit references are, of course, merely the surface appearance of the relation of the 
content of Heidegger’s system to that of Marx. The task of inter pretation is to bridge 
the gap between the explicit and the implicit. The ambiguity of Heidegger’s style, which surrounds a poverty of apparent content with an aura of hidden profundity, 
makes this task slippery. The range of possibilities is wide. Has Hei degger fallen so 
far behind Hegel philosophically that he cannot comprehend Marx’s advances? Or has his thought gone so far beyond us that it remains unintelligible? The truth of the 
matter probably lies near the center of the middle ground between these extremes; 
that, at least, is the heuristic principle of the present work.

Chapter III. A Marxist Critique of 
Heidegger 
The jargon of authenticity is a social disease and Adorno has set out to exterminate 
it.27 Heidegger’s writings, which try to conceal the ir promiscuous relation to 
reactionary, “merely ontical” forces, are infected with the ideological thrust of a vocabulary that thrives on ambiguity. “Authenticity,” a characteristic term in the 
jargon that Heidegger shared with many politicians, theologians and conservative 
ideologues, abstracts from social causes of discontent by giving contemporary feelings 
of meaninglessness an ahistorical formulation. Heidegger shirks responsibility for the 
claim inherent in the word “authenticity” to be presenting a p ositive doctrine of the 
good life when he insists that he is using the word as a value -free technical term, even 
while exploiting its fascination. That the alleged meaninglessness of life invalidates all 
principles of how to live, serves only to attract pe ople to a certain way of life. Adorno 
analyzes this process whereby the concepts of the jargon manage to give the pretense of dealing radically with the crucial issues of life, society and philosophy, while they 
merely substitute the aura of connotation -laden words for the required content. Their 
false appearance has, according to Adorno, led to the surprising appeal of Heidegger’s Being and Time and of the existentialism which it encouraged.  
Reading Adorno, on the contrary, it is easy to be initially unimp ressed. His style aims 
precisely at avoiding such thoughtless adherence to thoughts. Yet, what Adorno has 
to say has much of the urgency which in Heidegger’s writings tends to be illusory. 
Adorno’s critique of Heidegger, which cuts away the cancerous jargo n to save the 
concerns that have become self -defeating, is of particular relevance to the attempt to 
learn from Heidegger and Marx together. The Jargon of Authenticity , oriented around 
Adorno’s and Heidegger’s comparative sensibilities to language, stands as a 
prolegomenon to the confrontation between the two mainstreams of twentieth -
century continental thought.

Adorno’s Early Criticisms  
The forty- odd years of Adorno’s stance towards phenom enology and Heidegger 
began in his student years,  forming the basis  for some of his first conversations with 
Horkheimer and Benjamin and culminating when he was twenty in a doctoral 
dissertation on Husserl. The critique of Husserlian phenomenology was later 
developed in more dialectical terms in Zur Metakritik  der Erkennt nistheorie , which 
attacks the roots of many problems Adorno pointed to in Husserl’s student, Heidegger. Adorno’s first book, turning to another major influence on Heidegger, 
presents a rebuttal to existentialist ontology oriented on Kierkegaard, source of 
Heidegger’s existentialism. Schroyer’s forward to the translation of Jargon draws out 
this last connection.  
Perhaps most interesting of Adorno’s early writings is a series of three essays composed shortly after the publication of Heidegger’s Being and Time but only recently 
made available in Adorno’s posthumous collected works. The first, a programmatic 
inaugural address on The Relevance  of Philosophy delivered in 1931 when Adorno began 
teaching, reflects upon the contemporary situation of philosophy by eva luating the 
failings of the various schools of the day. This lecture is striking both in terms of the 
importance it attributes to Heidegger and the thoroughness with which it sees through 
his pretenses. Adorno deals here with three in stances of the necess ary failure of 
Heidegger’s accomp lishments to live up to the promises of his rhetoric: Being and 
Time’s pathos of a radical new beginning is rejected by placing its problematic firmly 
within the context of the impasses reached by Simmel, Rickert, Husserl and Scheler; 
Heidegger’s ethos of anti -idealistic concreteness is shown to be betrayed by his 
systemat ic method and presentation in Being and Time; the flaunted escape from 
subject -object metaphysics is understood by Adorno as a reduction to pure 
subjectivity.  
Adorno’s paper on The Idea of Natural -History , delivered a year later, views Heidegger’s 
concept of “historicity” – one which instantly grates on Marxist nerves – as a false 
reconciliation of nature and history, of eternal structures and contingent facts. For the 
ontological theory of history can only achieve an adequate interpretation of Being if 
it foregoes such orientation toward structures of possibility in favor of a radical 
exegesis of the actuality of beings in terms of their determinations within concrete social history.  
Finally, Adorno’s Theses on the Language  of the Philosopher criticizes Hei degger’s linguistic 
novelties in terms of the historical conditions on philosophic prose. According to Adorno’s theory, Heidegger’s terminological innovations flee from history without 
escaping it. Heidegger exploits a highly situated jargon as though it h ad ahistorical 
validity and absolutizes historical concepts within a destiny of Being, which is 
unaffected by the social context. Consequently, despite his fondness for word plays 
and etymologies, his praise of the poets and his worship of language as the historical 
Marx and Heidegger  
  50 
medium of being, Heidegger is accused by Adorno of lacking an aesthetic sensitivity 
to the social content of language, and this failing leaves him susceptible to the 
enticements of the jargon of authenticity and its unreflected provincialism. 
Anticipating the tack of Jargon, Adorno’s essay on language concludes that “all 
deceptive ontology is to be exposed by critique of language.”28 
Dialectic of Enlightenment , written with Max Horkheimer during the war, exhibits 
significant parallels to Heidegge r’s writings, although it never refers to existentialism, 
ontology or their prime spokesman. The project of tracing the concept of reason 
(scientific enlightenment, Vernunft , ratio, logos) from the pre -Socratics to the 
technological age in terms of literary and philosophical texts is as central to Adorno’s 
attempt to grasp the contemporary form of rationality, which had culminated in 
fascism, as to Heidegger’s essays of the same period which share that goal. This 
comparison suggests that the conflict expres sed in Jargon is not a matter of disparate 
world views hurling insults, but that despite his polemical tone Adorno agrees with Heidegger on the present concerns of philosophy as well as on certain methodological 
issues. Yet there are crucial differences. T he thesis which the Dialectic of Enlightenment  
substantiates, that the historic process of subject -formation has been accompanied by 
a de-subjectification through social forces and relations since time immemorial, is an 
implicit argument against ontology, whose concepts of man and Being cannot deal 
with the essential interpenetration in social history of that which these ontologized 
concepts leave abstract.  
Adorno’s Methodology of Critique  
That Adorno relates the development of rationality, the relationship  of myth to 
enlightenment, and various other concerns which he shares with Heidegger to Marx’s 
analysis of capitalist relations of production while Heidegger maintains a strict 
primacy for the evolution of the ontological categories, indicates that Adorno was 
speaking for himself as well when he described Benjamin’s attitude toward Heidegger. 
Noting Benjamin and Heidegger’s shared rejection of idealist abstractions and formal 
generality, Adorno emphasized, however, that “the decisive differences between 
philosophers have always consisted in nuances; what is most bitterly irreconcilable is 
that which is similar, but which thrives on different  centers; and Benjamin’s relation to 
today’s accepted ideologies of the ‘concrete’ is no different. He (Benjamin) saw 
through them as the mere mask of conceptual thinking at its wit’s end, just as he also 
 
28 Theodor W. Adorno, “Thesen über die Sprache des Philosophen,” Gesammelte 
Schriften I  (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1973).  
Marx and Heidegger  
  51 
rejected the existential- ontological concept of history as the mere distillate left after 
the substance of the historical dialectic had been boiled away.29 
Adorno seeks t o uncover the “center” on which Heidegger’s analyses and their 
popularity thrive, for this center gives form and significance to the configuration of 
Heidegger’s insights. The comprehension of the relation of this center to society – 
and not directly  Heide gger’s personal activity or class origins – provides the basis for a 
political judgment of Heidegger’s philosophy. This approach is characteristic of 
Adorno’s critical practice. According to his aesthetic theory, for instance, it is not the 
correspondence of individual contents of a work of art to specific social influences 
which accounts for the progressive or reactionary character of that work, but the way 
in which the work responds to prevailing social relations. Thus, in a letter to Walter 
Benjamin, Ado rno writes, “I regard it as methodologically unfortunate to give 
conspicuous individual features from the realm of the superstructure a ‘materialistic’ 
turn by relating them immediately and perhaps even causally to corresponding 
features of the infrastructure. Materialistic determination of cultural traits is only 
possible if it is mediated through the total social process .”30 
Adorno’s philosophical interpretations proceed by the same maxims. Heidegger’s 
work is treated neither simplistically nor determinis tically; it is neither rejected out of 
hand as mere bourgeois ideology nor uncritically accepted as autonomous 
contemplation. It is comprehended, rather, as an arena from which the forces at work 
throughout society are scarcely excluded and in which any tr uth that manages to make 
an appearance will necessarily be conditioned by those forces – in one way or another.  
Clearly, the penetration of social relations into Heidegger’s system can only be 
revealed through a thorough grasp of the philosophical propositions, but these are 
not taken as ends in themselves: between the lines a social force -field must be 
reconstructed. In a tribute to his boyhood friend, Siegfried Kracauer, Adorno 
summarizes this approach to philosophical interpretation : “If I later, when reading 
the traditional philosophical texts, let myself be less impressed by their unity and systematic coherence, but rather concerned myself with the play of the forces which 
worked on one another under the surface of each closed doct rine and considered the 
codified philosophies as in each case force -fields, then it was certainly Kracauer who 
inspired me to it.”
31 More than anything else, this oblique approach to philosophies – 
especially apparent in Jargon, which relates Heidegger to society in terms of the

Spearman, 1967), p. 231.

zur Literatur III (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1965).  
Marx and Heidegger  
  52 
medium of a politically -loaded language -game – makes Adorno’s critique of 
Heidegger difficult to grasp.  
Adorno’s Mature Criticisms  
For years Adorno avoided the frontal attack on Heidegger anticipated in the early 
essays. The systema tic intention of Dialectic of Enlightenment , probably to be attributed 
to Horkheimer, was uncharacteristic of Adorno. He spent his most productive years composing focused essays. Numerous references to Heidegger are sprinkled 
throughout these studies; the important discussions of Kafka and Beckett, for 
instance, interpret their subject matter as poetic critiques of Heidegger, in explicit renunciation of the popular existentialist readings. When, near the end of his life, 
Adorno did present his conception of  philosophy systematically, Heidegger was there 
front and center. Negative  Dialectics , the only extensive mature work completed unless 
one counts the monograph on Alban Berg, devotes the first of its three parts to 
Adorno’s “relation to ontology,” a critique of Heidegger which provides the starting 
point for Adorno’s own “anti -system.” Per haps the most significant contrast of 
Heidegger and Adorno would be one based on the latter’s posthumously published Aesthetische  Theorie . Such a study would, however, have few explicit connections to 
draw upon. Informed by the philosophical debates, it wo uld have to note the shared 
rejection of subjectivistic aesthetics and evaluate the relation of art to society in the 
respective theories. Short of this, Negative  Dialectics  and its offshoot, The Jargon of 
Authenticity , will have to be accepted as the defi nitive statements of Adorno’s critique 
of Heidegger.  
According to the introduction to Negative  Dialectics ,
32 the task of philosophy in our 
times is the transformation of subjectivistic thinking by means of the subjective 
strength of the critical individual . The subsequent priority of substance over the 
knowing subject implies a primary concern with the concrete, which has been 
distorted under the demands of a coercive social totality. Although method would 
then be determined by the subject matter, analysis could not proceed without 
concepts. This linguistic requirement presupposes a critique of the philosophical tradition, that is, of German idealism and of the inept criticism of idealism by 
positivism, phenomenology and existentialism. While these goals may  capture much 
of Heidegger’s stated intentions, according to Adorno’s account, Heidegger, like Husserl before him, has failed to deal adequately with the complexities involved in 
grasping the concrete.  
 
32 Theodor W. Adorno, Negative Dialectics  (New York: Seabury, 1973).  
Marx and Heidegger  
  53 
In Negative  Dialectics  Adorno suggests how the concret e is missed by Heidegger’s 
simplistic scheme, which underlies and supports an elaborate obscurantism. The three 
poles of Heidegger’s system – beings, human existence and Being – interpenetrate 
each other only formally, without taking into account their con figuration, which 
defines their content. The concrete social history in which these poles, as dialectical, 
intertwine and develop according to Hegel and, in effect, Marx, disappears in 
Heidegger’s presentation. Thereby their present forms are not clearly s ituated in 
history; as essential and eternal, they are, thinks Adorno, glorified and affirmed. The oft-bemoaned quietism of Heidegger’s later writings is thus revealed by Adorno to be 
non-accidental: it is a consequence of the very approach of the ontological project, 
one which excludes social content from the start.  
This criticism is particularly interesting because Adorno has also been accused of 
praxis  paralysis and because Heidegger can respond as Adorno has that his emphasis 
on contemplation is a react ion against a preponderance of thoughtless pragmatic 
activity in present society. The difference between the two philosophies is that 
receptivity becomes a dead -end in Heidegger’s system, rather than a corrective 
moment, which negates only the distortions and limitations of social practice. The 
philosophical source of the difference is that Heidegger’s approach reacts too 
simplistically to the dilemmas of post -Hegelian philosophy, attempting to skirt the 
problem of a non- idealistic mediation of subject and object, of thought and society, 
of theory and practice. Where Adorno radicalizes Hegel’s dialectic, redefining it in 
terms of the non -identity of word and object and articulating the mediations involved 
more thoroughly than even Hegel, Heidegger falls behi nd Hegel, hypostatizing 
language along with Being outside the influence of that reality which they characterize.  
This theoretical point has practical consequences for Heidegger’s philosophy insofar as he fails to reflect on the relat ion of society to his language. Heidegger’s fail ure to 
deal adequately with the present social context of philosophy is perhaps Adorno’s 
strongest indictment of him: his ontology is an unfortunate response to social 
conditions in which people feel powerless. In the guise of a cr itique of subjectivistic 
will, it fetishizes the illusion of powerlessness and thereby serves those in power. Following a restorative thrust, Heidegger’s formulation of a real felt need merely 
assumes a solution and thus serves to perpetuate the underlying  problems according 
to Adorno’s analysis. Strengthening conservative ideology, Heidegger’s approach avoids those issues that point to the realm of society, an arena in which people could 
possibly exert some joint control.  
The Jargon of Authenticity  is more  focused. Unlike Negative  Dialectics , which addresses 
itself to the central topoi of Heidegger’s thought as a whole, Jargon seems to limit itself 
to an area of questionable importance, although it brings an impressive array of 
considerations to bear. Deali ng with Heidegger’s pivotal “question of Being” only 
peripherally, it is preoccupied by the accompanying doctrine of man. Further, it zeroes in on terms and themes which Heidegger himself dropped after Being and Time. Thus, 
Marx and Heidegger  
  54 
of the four sections of Adorno’s essay (beginning on pages 3, 49, 92 and 130), the 
first reflects on the jargon in the hands of Heidegger’s predecessors, colleagues and 
followers, barely mentioning Heidegger himself. The next section fits Heidegger into 
this picture, but notes that Heide gger protects himself against the imputation of the 
jargon’s worst offences even while exploiting its appeal. Another part is devoted to the concept of authenticity, which Heidegger never again used so freely after the 
reaction to his first book. In the fi nal pages, the choice of the analysis of death as an 
illustration of Heidegger’s procedure involves Adorno in the non -intuitive argument 
that people might overcome death in a future social arrangement. Even if this is 
possible – and in Jargon it remains an  empty possibility – Heidegger has still articulated 
the importance of finitude as an essential feature of the human condition as we know 
it. Concentrating as he does on the social consequences of Heidegger’s concepts of 
authenticity and death, Adorno seem s to miss the role these play in Heidegger’s 
ontology. For authentic Being -towards- death is less a moral stance in Heidegger’s 
system than a condition of the possibility of valid ontological reflection.  
Jargon thus seems open to the very criticism it level s against Being and Time, namely that 
the pragmatic impact on the reader is not substantiated by the propositional evidence. 
Just as the popularity of Heidegger’s work was attributed by Adorno largely to moral 
connotations explicitly excluded from the epis temological discourse, so  it seems that 
Adorno’s own essay gives the impression of utterly destroying Heidegger’s philosophy when it merely picks at incidental themes without understanding their import.  
Viewed from the perspective of Negative  Dialectics , however, Heidegger’s analysis of 
human existence is symptomatic of his later investigations of tool, artwork, thing and 
word, even of Being itself. Although th e structures of man, thing and B eing include, 
on Heidegger’s account, relations to each other, the  concrete social history in terms 
of which they affect each other through these otherwise abstract relations is left out 
of consideration. This fault can be demonstrated just as meaningfully in terms of 
Heidegger’s early Daseinsanalytik  as with the later Seinsfrage, and the political 
implications that follow from either are more clearly drawn out of the former. In short, Jargon’s oblique social attack on the linguistic aspect of a supposedly moralistic 
part of Heidegger’s early thought succeeds in making th oroughly problematic many 
central characteristics of Heidegger’s approach and system in general.  
Significantly, Adorno’s social critique of Heidegger is not simply divorced from a philosophical one. Rather, it underscores the philosophical failure of Heide gger’s 
thought: its lack of concern for the very social dimension in which it becomes self -
defeating. This particular failure necessitates the confrontation between Heidegger’s 
and Marxist critical theory of society. By determining the social limitations o f 
Heidegger’s thought, Adorno does not discard Heidegger, but attunes the strivings of Heidegger’s philosophical concepts to their social content, measuring the distance 
between their claims and their achievements. Only thereby can Marxism interpret 
Heideg ger’s insights within the context of Marxism’s own method and fruitfully 
Marx and Heidegger  
  55 
comprehend both the progressive and the reactionary force of Heidegger’s socially 
situated  path of thought.

  57 
Chapter IV. Anticipations: The 
Early Works 
Marxism is not just one more show in a repertoire of philosophical fantasies. When 
the curtain rises, it is not to reveal a self -contained , harmonic production, but rather 
to present the analysis of the drama which unfolds itself outside. No passive entertainment, the show charges admission: active commitment to a better world. The 
line, “something is foul in the state of Denmark,” is not di scovered mid -way, but 
presupposed by the whole. Marxism is the philosophy of revolution, stating the 
preconditions for change, but not deducing its desirability as though it required proof. 
Construed as a system, Marx’s thought presupposes only the self -contradictory social 
reality which it articulates.  
Insofar as one distinguishes Marx’s thought from the social system he criticizes, the 
presupposition of the latter by the former can be viewed in two ways. Marx’s 
methodology is a response to the contradicto ry character of capitalist society, while 
his interpretation of that society as fundamentally contradictory is related to his critical approach. This paradoxical or, perhaps better, circular structure to Marx’s project 
defines its uniqueness. Rejecting the  relativism of manifold worldviews – which are 
at any rate unconsciously conditioned by social relations – Marx develops his outlook 
through research into social objectivity. At the same time, he avoids pre -critical 
metaphysics by realizing that the comprehension of capitalist society presupposes a theoretical frame work. The priority of social existence over thought, due at least to 
the fact that any thinker finds himself always already within a social structure which he did not create, rescues from the ch arge of arbitrariness even Marx’s most basic 
critical intention, itself a consequence of the inadequacies of the society in which he 
found himself. The partial identity, through mediation, of subject and object, of social 
critic and capitalist society, man ifests itself in the tendential identity of the 
theoretician’s social critique of theory and capitalist society’s theoretical critique of its own contradictory character.  
The anti -philosophical remarks of the early Marx outline only a fraction of the 
exten sive system of thought they implicate; they represent the mere peak of an iceberg 
kept submerged of late in the murky waters of cold- war rhetoric. Broken off of the 
whole, an isolated sampling of Marx’s thought must dissolve like an ice cube in an 
eclectic  cocktail of ideas, watering down the potency while pretending to 
revolutionize. The point is to comprehend the unity of Marx’s thought in its relation to social reality and practice. Dependent upon its social context for the content of its 
presuppositions , Marxism nevertheless carries out its analysis autonomously, using 
the historically given categories and contradictions to transcend their own apparent 
Marx and Heidegger  
  58 
limitations. The results stand as a condemnation of existing social relations, but not 
as a merely mora l disgust. Rather, truth and falsity have been separated out of 
ideology, concepts have been re -forged through criticism, the cores of problems have 
been exposed and potentials for rectification have been revealed.  
The guiding theme of the following interp retation of Marx is that he places the 
concept of commodity production at the center of his theory of bourgeois (capitalist) society, with profound consequences for the philosophical trappings of this theory. 
Such an understanding of Marx is in conscious o pposition to several prevalent 
tendencies in the secondary literature. Too often Marx’s youthful references to alienation in the Manuscripts  are sighted as moralistic, psychologistic or idealistic – at 
any rate, crudely separated from the mature economic a nalyses. The notion of praxis  
in the Theses is hypostatized into the basis of an ontology of praxis , as though the 
concept was not designed in this context precisely to attack the ahistorical 
conceptualizations of Feuerbach. In contrast to those philosophi cally speculative 
interpretations, other discussions take Marx’s political economy to be merely an empirical science whose validity stands and falls solely in the comparison of its 
isolated parts to competing hypotheses in that science: from Adam Smith to Paul 
Samuelson. The historical footnotes to Capital  – most extensively elaborated in the 
section on “Forms Which Precede Capitalist Production” in the Grundrisse – are taken 
by many to be identical either to Hegelian universal history, thought to reduce hi story 
to an empty tripartite schema, or to naive historiology, the attempt to restate “that 
which was.” It is necessary to oppose these procedures of divide and conquer which 
tear the unity of Marx’s thought asunder along chronological lines by distinguish ing 
Marx the philosopher, sociologist, economist, revolutionary, humanist and private citizen, thereby, intentionally or not, reducing each misunderstood segment to 
meaninglessness under the pretext of saving it from a questionable whole.  
The opposition to  the fragmentation of Marx’s work receives its justification in the 
essential unity of Marx’s underlying purposes throughout his writings. in focusing on 
commodity production, the interpretation emphasizes that cornerstone of Marx’s 
analyses which is impli citly intended with the terms “alienated labor” and “ praxis ,” 
explicitly with those of “production,” “free labor” and “commodity fetishism.” Accordingly, the two most popular early writings, Alienated Labor (August 1844) and 
Theses on Feuerbach  (March 1845 ), will be interpreted by, in effect, introducing the 
concept of commodity production into the discussions which are couched in more 
ambiguous terms: alienated labor and social praxis . Through this paraphrasing, Marx 
will be shown to be arguing similar poi nts in his early, philosophical works as in his 
mature, economic writings, subsequently to be considered. The “Introduction” 
(August/September 1857) to the Grundrisse presents the most explicit argument for 
using the concept of commodity production as the basis for an understanding of the 
capitalist system. The historical account in the Grundrisse, the chapter on “Forms 
Which Precede Capitalist Production” (December/January 1858), is not a history in 
Marx and Heidegger  
  59 
the normal sense, but a retrospective account of  the deve lopment of the material 
preconditions of commodity production.  
Finally, it will merely be necessary to round out the picture of the unity of Marx’s 
work with a glance at Capital  (1867), which recapitulates the by now familiar themes 
in the terms of a fully elaborated system. Here the commodity is analyzed into its two  
aspects: use value and exchange value; the contradiction between these is shown to 
be at the root of fetishism; and the theory of surplus value, which also derives from 
this contradiction in commodity production, is elaborated into a theory of industrial 
society. Of particular interest are the relation Marx establishes between his procedure 
of abstraction and developments in society; the ontological implications he draws 
from the commodity character of the products of capitalist production; and the use 
of the results of these analyses for his demystification of fetishism.  
 The Primacy of Commodity Production for 
Interpretation  
The joy of liberal revisionism and the embarrassment of reactionary dogmatism find their source in Marx’s early manuscripts, texts w hich therefore provide a natural 
starting point for a contemporary evaluation of Marx’s foundations for social theory. 
Marx’s popular discussion of alienated labor, when carefully viewed as an analysis of 
commodity production, is a first major document of his “turn” from philosophy and 
law to political economy as the object of ideology critique. Although not yet the explicit center of attention, the concept of the commodity is already present, to be 
developed in the succeeding thirty years in terms of the c ontradiction between use 
value and exchange value, the labor form of value and the appropriation of surplus value. Moreover, Marx’s method of starting from the given reality and the prevalent 
ideologies to develop his own conceptualizations  is clearly at work, despite the 
misleading form of logical (dialectical) derivations from the concept. A further cause for confusion is Marx’s penchant for adapting traditionally metaphysical terms to an 
anti-metaphysical project. (This procedure is not without its justi fications, but the 
danger of mis interpretation is enormous, as is clear from the way it confused 
Heidegger, who had himself used the technique against metaphysics.) With these 
dangers in mind, we turn to Marx’s most controversial ten-page text. 
The first of the Economic -Philosophic Manuscripts  (1844) is divided under the traditional 
headings of political economy: “Wages of Labor,” “Profit of Capital” and “Rent of 
Land,” with a concluding section referred to as “Alienated Labor.” This last section 
begins by  summarizing the procedure and results of what preceded:  
Marx and Heidegger  
  60 
We have proceeded from the presuppositions of political economy. 
We have accepted its language and its laws. We presupposed private 
property, the separation of labor, capital and land, hence of wages , 
profit of capital and rent, likewise the division of labor, competition, 
the concept of exchange value, etc. From political economy itself, in 
its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of 
a commodity, the most miserable commodity; t hat the misery of the 
worker is inversely proportional to the power and volume of his production; that the necessary result of competition is the 
accumulation of capital in a few hands and thus the revival of 
monopoly in a more frightful form; and finally that the distinction 
between capitalist and landowner, between agricul tural laborer and 
industrial worker, disappears and the whole society must divide into 
the two classes of proprietors  and property -less workers.
33 
Marx’s procedure is a dialectical form of “immanent critique.” In criticizing the 
theories of bourgeois political economy, Marx does not attack from an alternative 
position based on its own set of presuppositions, but starts out from the most highly 
developed form of that theory itself. From within the questionable position, Marx 
subjects its concepts, suppositions and analyses to a form of critical self -reflection, 
calling them into question by relating them to each other, seeking their origins, and 
furthe r developing them into a reductio  ad absurdum . Thus, “just exchange” leads by a 
development of its very logic to its opposite: an inverse relationship between the worker’s wealth and the value of his products; competition likewise results in 
monopoly; and,  finally, the separation of capital and landownership  develops into a 
unified class of proprietors.  
Where has political economy gone wrong, then, according to Marx? It starts from the fact of private property, but it establishes this fact in abstract laws rather than 
analyzing it in terms of (1) related concepts, (2) its historical origin or (3) its implications: 
Political economy proceeds from the fact of private property. It does not explain private property. It grasps (fassen ) the actual, material  
proces s of private property in abstract and general formulas, which 
it then takes as laws. It does not comprehend (begreifen) these laws, that

  61 
is, does not prove them as proceeding from the nature of private 
property.34 
In terms of the distinction drawn in Chapt er I above between explanation and 
interpretation (Marx uses the terms grasp and comprehend), traditional political 
economy has limited itself to explaining market phenomena in terms of a set of laws 
and concepts, without bothering to interpret these laws and concepts within an 
encompassing theory of society so that the laws and concepts could be comprehended 
as elements of a meaningful whole. Of course, the political economists did have a 
world view in terms of which they interpreted their economic theory,  but this 
bourgeois ideology (in the strictest sense of the term) was merely superimposed on 
the science: it did not grow out of the relationships within the science. Further, both 
the ideology and the science lacked reflection upon their historical limita tions. Marx’s 
originality lay in the unifying of explanatory science and interpretive framework. 
Incorporating historical reflection at the heart of this unity, Marx’s thought becomes 
“theory,” lacking the arbitrariness of world view and the provinciality of ideology.  
Marx’s dialectical “comprehension” of the phenomenon of private property can be 
conceived as a three -pronged attack: (1) He sets out to “grasp the essential connection  
among private property, greed, division of labor, capital, …” (2) He wants to show 
how the concepts and relationships of capitalism are “necessary, inevitable, natural 
consequences” of an historical development  whose previous stage of feudalism in corpo -
rated monopoly, the guild  and feudal property. (3) As a result of these analys es, he 
hopes to dispel the ideology  of private property, just exchange, individualism. Marx’s 
strategy – in the Manuscripts , as in later writings – is to show that commodity  production  is 
the essential  determinant, specifying the historical content of prop erty, exchange and the 
individual in bourgeois society.  
Anticipating this priority of the productive realm, Marx starts from a fact about 
production, rather than about property, later deriving private property as a 
consequence of capitalist relations of pr oduction. Rejecting the traditional starting 
point of philosophy with some unconditioned concept or situation – Hegel’s “Being” 
or political economy’s “state of nature” – Marx proceeds from a “political -economic, 
present  fact.” Not only is this an economic fact visible in the contemporary society – 
as was the political economist’s fact of private property – but it is a theoretical “fact” 
at this stage of analysis in Marx’s Manuscripts,  the result of his preceding immanent  
critique of the theories of the political economists. The fact, a moral indictment of 
capitalism, a contradiction in its ideology and an indication of its severe limitations, is 
formulated as follows:  
The worker becomes poorer the more wealth he produces,  the more 
his production increases in power and extent. The worker becomes 
 
34 Ibid., p. 287, S. 51.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  62 
a cheaper commodity the more commodities he produces . . .. labor 
not only produces commodities. It produces itself and the worker as 
a commodity .35 
That such a “fact” provides the b asis of Marx’s theory in his manuscript is revealing 
of its anti -epistemological attitude. The belief that no theory of knowledge can 
independently precede the theory of society is premised upon a conclusion Marx later 
elaborated in The German Ideology : the sensuous world is the product of industry and 
societal conditions; it is an historical result. Rejecting Kant’s emphasis on ahistorical and non -social categories of pure reason, Marx saw the condition of the possibility of 
knowledge, whether scientific o r everyday, in the present totality of social practice. 
More in agreement with Hegel that knowledge – as the mediation of subject and 
object with the help of concepts – is itself mediated by the object rather than merely 
structured by an unmediated conscio usness, Marx nevertheless rejected Hegel’s 
concern with the concept as origin and result of the historical process. The concept 
is relegated by Marx to the position of an intermediate moment in the comprehension 
of socio- historical reality. Marx’s theory p resupposes an objective world already 
mediated by historical human activity. His goal is to comprehend this world by conceptually articulating the mediations that define it. For these reasons, Marx begins 
with a fact of present reality. That this fact is k nown a posteriori , does not leave its 
choice arbitrary. Anticipating the analysis to follow, it is chosen centrally so as to 
provide essential categories that can be elaborated in the final theory. Consequently, 
as sub sequent research reveals new insights , the starting point of the presentation 
must be modified.  
The fact from which Marx starts in the manuscripts is historically specific, not valid 
for all times, but this does not mean it was chronologically limited to Marx’s time and 
perhaps explainable b y accidental circumstances of politics or inflation. Rather, the 
fact is stated with complete generality. Its specificity first becomes apparent when one 
notes that workers did not always produce large amounts of “wealth” – traditional 
peasants produced ma inly food for themselves and their dependents. The worker has 
not primarily produced “commodities” in all epochs, previously he produced mostly 
“use values” for immediate consumption, rather than “exchange values” for sale. 
Marx’s fact is thus just as time ly as commodity  production  itself as the dominant form of 
production. When Marx refers to production in his essay, he is thinking of commodity production; labor is wage labor which produces commodities in exchange for money; 
products are commodities made s olely for the purpose of being sold; private property 
is the ownership of the material preconditions of commodity production; and wealth 
is abstract value, the monetary worth of commodities. These concepts of political 
economy are thus components of a theo ry of capitalist society. Their content is defined 
by the relationships that inhere in this system as distinguished from other systems, 
 
35 Ibid., p. 289, S. 52.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  63 
such as the feudal society out of which it grew. This already suggests the importance 
of Marx’s three -fold procedure: (1 ) To grasp the systematic connections among the 
concepts is not only part of what it means to analyze the concepts themselves, but 
also a necessary step in relating the concepts to social reality. (2) Tracing the logic of 
development of the concepts as asp ects of the real social system dispels the myth of 
eternality, suggesting future contradictory developments and a perspective for revolutionary change. (3) The first two steps involve a rejection of liberal ideology, 
which ignores and distorts the conceptu al interrelation ships and enthrones the 
concepts in an aura of eternality and necessity.  
By carefully distinguishing capitalism from previous social systems and drawing the consequences of this distinction for theories of society, Marx transcended Hegel a nd 
Adam Smith simultaneously and criticized both economic theory and practice in one 
blow. For it then became clear that production of commodities is “alienated” labor 
not merely in the Hegelian sense of a subject externalizing himself in the objective 
world – applicable to all forms of society and scarcely to be transcended outside the 
realm of mind – but in the capitalistic sense that the product is someone else’s 
property. With this all- important twist, the dialectic of consciousness with nature, its 
recognition of the other and its coming to self -awareness are essentially altered. It can 
then be seen that Hegel is just as guilty as the economists, from whom he gleaned 
much of his material, of treating certain bourgeois categories, such as private propert y, 
without concern for their social specificity and therefore without awareness of their actual content. The apologetic nature of political economy, precisely in its utopian 
ambitions, can be attributed to its absolutizing of capitalist categories, judging  all past 
and possible social forms by the standards inherent in capitalism alone, and necessarily concluding that capitalism is the most “rational” (in this context itself an 
enlightenment value with specifically capitalistic content). Only by carefully 
distinguishing that which is unique to capitalist reality and its conceptualizations, can 
Marx reveal how capitalism entails both new emancipatory potentials and increased repressions. 
The Alienated World  
Marx’s often puzzling remarks and rambling style in the Manuscripts  can be greatly 
clarified simply by bearing in mind that alienated labor always refers to commodity production. Marx literally underlines this when he writes: “ Political  economy  conceals  the 
alienation  in the nature of labor by ignoring  the direct relationship between the laborer (labor) and 
production .”
36 Marx traces the effect upon the laborer of the fact that his labor is part 
 
36 Ibid., p. 291, S. 54.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  64 
of the process of commodity production; the whole analysis of alienation follows 
from this. Centering on the laborer, Marx successively shows that, as a result of 
alienation from h is product as something that will neither belong to him nor be 
consumed by him, the laborer is alienated from (1) nature, (2) himself, (3) humanity, 
and (4) other people.37 These manifold forms of alienation are results of the “present 
fact of political ec onomy” from which Marx starts out. The contradictory 
relationships in which the wage laborer becomes entangled stem from the central 
contradiction: commodity production. Production in general is the appropriation 
(Aneignung , making one’s own) of nature, bu t commodity production specifically is 
making something someone else’s – the capitalist’s and then the purchaser’s – thus 
alienation (Entfremdung , making strange). These contradictions are not mere figments 
of logic, but historical results.  
 (1) Viewed his torically, the introduction of commodity production into an economy 
based on self -sustaining economic units (extended family or estate) with marginal 
trade started a process which led to the dissolution of those units, the establishment 
of a commodity -based economy and the progressive impoverishment of the workers 
relative to the social standard of living. The more the worker turned from the direct satisfaction of his specific needs to commodity production, the less he owned in the 
way of materials, equipme nt and even food. Increasingly, the worker had to turn to 
someone else who could supply these preconditions of labor and life. Eventually, the 
laborer was left with nothing but his physical labor power, and he was reliant upon 
selling that to keep alive. S eparated from the land and hereditary estate, the worker 
became alienated from nature as source of the preconditions of  his occupational and 
physical existence because these preconditions now belonged to someone else. This 
is one sense in which the worker becomes poorer the more commodities he produces: 
 
37 This is Marx’s list in his man uscript. Since 1844, commodity relations – originating 
in the relation of the laborer to his product as a commodity – have spread throughout 
all sectors of society. Marxist cultural criticism (Lukacs, Benjamin, Adorno, e.g.) has, 
for instance, more recentl y analyzed the consequent effect on art. The recent 
emphasis upon consumption, which some would argue makes Marxism obsolete, can itself be traced to the relations of production, as Enzensberger suggests in his reply 
to the argument that ecological conside rations call for moderation by consumers 
(Hans -Magnus Enzensberger, “Critique of political ecology,” New Left Review, No. 
84, p. 30; Cf. the quotation from Marx in footnote 3 above):  
To ask the individual wage -earner to differentiate between his ‘real’ and  his 
‘artificial’ needs is to mistake his real situation. Both are so closely 
connected that they constitute a relationship which is subjectively and 
objectively invisible. Hunger for commodities, in all its blindness, is a 
product of the production of com modities, which could only be suppressed 
by force.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  65 
he becomes alienated from nature. This alienation is a result of commodity production 
itself as a mode of production and as a determinant of historical development.  
 (2) Another such result is the determinat ion of the laborer himself as a commodity. 
No longer producing in accordance with his particular needs and desires, his activity, 
which he is forced to sell on the market, is usually controlled by someone else and is 
always aimed at satisfying needs of som e unknown, hence abstract, other. Divorced 
from the source of the meaning of his own existence, his own activity, the laborer is alienated from himself . An illegitimate metaphysical distinction has been drawn – by 
society, not by thought – between the indi vidual and his activity, where the latter 
belongs to some other individual. A pervasive schizo phrenia has manifested itself in 
society, leaving a whole class of people with not two, but only half a personality.  
 (3) The fragmentation of the worker – not only into psychological ego and objective 
activity, but into cripplingly specialized fragments of activity – is particularly 
disturbing because it comes as the result of the process of progressive universality. 
Capitalism involved the dissolution of the tra ditional limitations upon human 
development and brought with it the tech nology to create universally, according to 
“intrinsic standards.” The freedom potentially available to the individual as a result of 
his belonging to the “present and living species” is, however, repressed by the form 
of commodity production, which reduces this “free spontaneous activity” to a mere 
means for the laborer’s physical existence. Unable to benefit from humanity’s great 
advances, the wage laborer is alienated from the very n otion of mankind , an ideal 
unattainable, foreign to its members.  
 (4) In the end, the commodity -based economy reduces human communities to the 
“war of all against all” which political economy and bourgeois philosophy had projected back to society’s origins . Alienated from his product, nature, himself and 
mankind, the laborer is necessarily alienated from others, whether they be the Capitalists 
who appropriate the product immediately, the purchasers who finally consume it or 
fellow workers who compete for jo bs. The other, who once may have helped out for 
the common good or shared a common world, has in capitalist society become part of a system which tears the laborer’s life and world asunder. The abstract nature of 
commodity relations, which reduce everythin g to monetary terms, pits the laborer 
concretely against society as the Fichtean Other.  
Marx’s classic presentation of alienated labor in its various aspects has not yet turned 
to the social context in which commodity production unfolds its consequences. I n 
analyzing alienation, Marx has analyzed the structural relations between the laborer 
and his product in the process of commodity production and he has done this in 
terms of the effects upon the laborer. Next,  he must turn to the historic process in 
which  commodity production establishes itself. Marx has only one further point to 
make, namely that the existence  of the capitalist is a necessary corollary to alienated labor. 
After all, Marx reasons, if the product of labor is alien to its producer, it must belong to another person. Further, the laborer will necessarily relate to this other person in 
Marx and Heidegger  
  66 
terms of the process of production as an “alien, hostile, powerful man independent 
of him,” as the lord of his product.  
The process of production thus creates, al ong with alienation in its various aspects, 
the relation in which the producer stands to the lord of labor, the owner of the 
materials and means of production, the designator of the details of production, the 
payer of wages for support. the owner of the pr oduct. “The relations of alienated 
labor, of commodity production, thus produce the relation of the capitalist to labor. Private  property  is thus product, result and necessary consequence of externalized  labor, 
of the external relation of the laborer to na ture and to himself.”
38 Private property is 
another expression of capital, as opposed to the wages of labor. The point is that the 
accumulation of wealth (materials, equipment and money) in the hands of a few is a 
necessary consequence of commodity production by the masses. Poli tical economy, 
by contrast, starts from the concept of private property as though it were an ageless notion and from an imaginary primordial situation in which most people had no 
property and therefore had to exchange their labor time for money to meet the ir 
needs. Wage labor was thus said to result from private property, if, indeed, a relation was ever drawn. This prevalent view justifies alienated labor, then, in terms of the 
ideology of just exchange. Marx’s view, on the other hand, shows commodity 
produ ction to be not only the basis of an exploitative system, but the original cause 
of the inequitable distribution of wealth as well – far from a rational solution to a 
“natural” inequality.  
In true dialectical fashion, Marx not only builds his new view on t he rubble of the 
ideological edifice he destroyed, but indicates as well how the mistaken appearance 
arose: “Only at the final culmination of the development of private property does 
this, its secret, reappear – namely, that on the one hand it is the product of externalized 
labor and that secondly it is the means through which labor externalizes itself, the 
realization  of this externalization .”
39 
We can reconstruct the history of private property as follows: Early, undeveloped 
forms of private property such  as merchants’  capital provided a basis for commodity 
production to begin through organization of traditional home crafts into manufacturing systems. This heralded the social division of labor into property -less 
laborer and propertied non -laborers. Althoug h presupposing the existence of private 
property in some elementary form, commodity production itself reproduced and 
developed its preconditions; it was a motor of the capitalist accumu lation which 
bourgeois political economy projected back to an ahistori cal state of nature in which 
the clever and physically powerful greedily took from the weaker people. Because commodity production historically presupposes private property, property was 
 
38 Cf. ibid., p. 297, S. 60.  
39 Ibid., p. 298, S. 60.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  67 
assumed to be systematically prior. In its developed form, however – as industrial 
capital – it is a result. The secret of private property is really a secret of commodities 
and their fetishism, for property is the fetishization of interpersonal relations. This is 
a problem whose explication must await the discussion of Capital. Here it is merely 
important to note Marx’s characteristic insight that what is historically prior may at the end of its development retrospectively be seen to be logically derivative in terms 
of a contemp orary conceptual framework of interpretation.  
Marx draws two conclusions from his consideration of private property and the 
externalized labor of commodity production. First, he claims that one can develop all 
the categories of political economy with the aid of the concept of alienated labor and 
that each resultant category (like private property) will be but a particular aspect 
thereof. Alienation, in the sense of the character of the relations of commodity 
production, is thus the analytic “essence” of the capitalist system. Marx’s second 
conclusion is that the analysis of the historical roots of our society should be 
structured in terms of the relationship of externalized labor to the history of mankind, 
rather than as the traditional search for the origins of private property.  
These two conclusions are central to Marx’s later writings. The “Introduction” to the 
Grundrisse argues for the importance of the role played by the essential analytic concept 
and the opening chapter of Capital  presents the concept of the commodity as such an 
essence in terms o f which one can develop all the other categories of a theory of 
capitalist society. On the other hand, the section of the Grundrisse on the “Forms 
Which Precede Capitalist Production” traces the development up to and during the 
bourgeois era in terms of the relationship of the forms of labor to the progress of 
mankind. Finally, drawing on all this, Capital  presents an historically spec ific analysis 
of capitalist production in terms of the form of value which corresponds to alienated labor. 
If Marx’s argument in the manuscript on alienated labor appears shaky or his 
vocabulary misleading, retaining concepts like “alienation” and “externa lization” from 
Feuerbach and Hegel, whom he criticized, rather than ex plicitly referring to 
commodity production throughout, perhaps this explains his not publishing the 
manuscripts. Perhaps this is a reason for going on to the later formulations, rather 
than for rejecting Marx as idealistic, impressionistic, existentialistic. After a look at his 
Theses on Feuerbach , de rigueur for a consideration of his key concepts, we will pick up 
Marx’s argument about commodity production in those sections of the Grund risse and 
Capital  referred to. They should provide adequate additional experience with his 
approach.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  68 
Ideology Critique and the Transformation of the 
World  
Marx’s Theses on Feuerbach  deserve to be quoted in full and commented on individually:  
 (1) The chief  defect of all previous materialism (including 
Feuerbach’s) is that the object, reality, sensuousness is conceived 
only in the form of the object or image, but not as sensuous  human activity,  
practice , not subjectively. Hence in opposition to materialism t he active 
side was developed abstractly by idealism, which naturally does not 
know actual, sensuous activity as such. Feuerbach wants sensuous 
objects actually different from thought objects: but he does not 
comprehend human activity itself as objective activity. Hence in The 
Essence  of Christianity  he regards only the theoretical attitude as the 
truly human attitude, while practice is understood only in its dirtily 
Jewish form of appearance. Consequently,  he does not comprehend 
the significance of “revolut ionary,” of “practical critical” activity.40 
Production as Marx’s analytic category is a synthesis of the constitutive function and of sensuous perception, of Hegelian idealism and Feuerbachian materialism. Social 
practice, defined by the prevailing form o f production and the corresponding social 
relations, is thus the activity by which mankind constitutes the objective world in which it is actively situated, not merely the adoption of a theoretical or passively 
receptive stance toward an external world. On ce this is recognized, it becomes clear 
that critical activity involves actually changing the mode of production, a far cry from 
stopping with the initial step of changing a few people’s minds as did Hegel and 
Feuerbach.  
 (2) The question whether human thi nking can reach objective truth 
is not a question of theory, but a practical  question. In practice man 
must prove the truth, that is, actuality and power, this -sidedness of 
his thinking. The dispute about the actuality or non -actuality of 
thinking, thinkin g isolated from practice, is a purely scholastic 
question.  
Thought cannot meaningfully be divorced from the reality of social practice: not only because that provides its object, but because the thinker is historically situated. Thus, 
even in the case of a  utopian vision, its truth lies in the possibilities of its achievement, 
not merely in the abstract validity of its arguments and values. (Cf. thesis #11 on the 
unity of theory and practice.)  
 
40 The Theses on Feuerbach are quoted in full from the Writings  cited in footnote 1 
above and are compared with the German from the Texte, p. 400ff, S. 19 0ff. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  69 
 (3) The materialistic doctrine concerning the change of 
circums tances and education forgets that circum stances are changed 
by men and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this 
doctrine must divide society into two parts, one of which towers 
above. The coincidence of the change of circum stances and of 
human activity or self -change can be comprehended and rationally 
understood only as revolutionary  practice . 
The glimmers of hope twinkling in the future and the most progressive thoughts of 
the age have a common source: possibilities inherent in the past and  present. There 
is no standpoint of objective knowledge on the other side of now and anyone who 
wants to help consciously create a better future – for the future will be created by 
people whether they consciously and democratically direct their efforts or let other 
people manipulate them – must educate himself about the society and potentials for 
change by situating his thought in the context of the revolutionary task of his society. 
Such self -education can take place only in unity with an activity which tr ansforms the 
social circumstances in which all thought is founded. Transformative practice, if it is to be self -conscious, necessarily transforms the theory of society along with the mode 
of production.  
 (4) Feuerbach starts out from the fact of religious self-alienation, the 
duplication of the world into a religious and secular world. His work 
consists in resolving the religious world into its secular basis. But the 
fact that the secular basis becomes separate from itself and 
establishes an independent rea lm in the clouds can only be explained 
by the cleavage and self -contradictoriness of the secular basis. Thus,  
the latter must itself be both understood in its contradiction and 
revolutionized in practice. For instance, after the earthly family is 
found to be the secret of the holy family, the former itself must then 
be theoretically and practically nullified.  
The key to uncovering forgotten potentials is the ideology critique of repressed 
embarrassments. Non -radical criticism is satisfied to stop after expo sing the 
embarrassment in the first of the five steps which constitute ideology critique: (a) 
Demystify; reveal the ideology to be a false consciousness. (b) State the social causes 
of the rationalization; uncover its social necessity. (c) Construct a theo ry of society 
from the hints given by the ideology’s moment of truth and by the specific necessity of its false aspect. (d) Analyze the possibilities of changing the society in terms of 
eliminating the social contradictions, which necessitated the ideology  and redirecting 
the energies which it sublimated. (e) Follow the inherent demands of the ideology critique to change society at its roots; transform the essence of man, human practice.  
Religion, as an opiate, not only acts as a narcotic in blurring the pe rception of social 
domination (by despot, aristocracy, king or capitalist) by substituting the illusory 
image of God, but it stands as a symptom in which critical thought can discern an

oppression of consciousness necessitated by economic enslavement. No l onger 
worshipped in their sublimated image, the chains which are the proletariat’s only 
possession become an abomination to their captives. The struggle for eman cipation 
is the natural consequence of an ideology critique founded in social objectivity and encouraged to run its course.  
 (5) Feuerbach, not satisfied with abstract  thinking , wants perception but 
he does not comprehend sensuousness as practical  human- sensuous 
activity.  
The rejection of the idealist’s transcendental ego cannot rest content with p lacing the 
mind in a body conceived of in ahistorical -biological terms. As essentially practical 
activity, sensuous perception takes place in an historically specific social context. 
 (6) Feuerbach resolves the religious essence into the human essence. 
But the essence of man is no abstraction inhering in each single 
individual. In its actuality it is the ensemble of social relationships. 
Feuerbach, who does not go into the criticism of this actual essence, 
is hence compelled (1) to abstract from the histori cal process and to 
establish religious feeling as something self -contained and to 
presuppose an abstract – isolated – human individual; (2) to view the 
essence of man merely as “species,” as the inner, dumb generality 
which unites the many individuals naturally . 
The essence of man is in each instance related to the present and living species, defined by its social practice. The essence is not to be sought in the biological 
specimen, but in the ensemble of social relations. Social theory’s question, What is 
man?, today finds its answer in the capitalist relations of production, not in supposedly 
eternal abstractions.  
 (7) Feuerbach does not see, consequently, that “religious feeling” is 
itself a social product and that the abstract individual he analyzes 
belongs to a particular form of society.  
The individual – underlying substrate for ahistorical definitions of man – is itself a 
product of historical development and ideological sophistication.  
 (8) All social life is essentially practical . All mysteries that lead theory 
to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and the comprehension of this practice.  
The comprehension of bourgeois social practice as the origin of fetishism is the key to untangling the confusions and illusions s urrounding social existence.  
 (9) The highest point attained by perceptual materialism, that is, 
materialism that does not comprehend sensuousness as practical 
activity, is the view of separate individuals and civil society.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  71 
The highest stage reached by philosophy before Marx, or by those subsequent 
philosophies which did not learn from him, was still restricted by the limitations of 
bourgeois society and the controlling interests of the bourgeoisie, for it did not reflect 
upon the effects of i ts social preconditions.  
 (10) The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society; the 
standpoint of the new is human society or socialized humanity.  
In transcending the limitations of bourgeois philosophy by reflecting upon the 
limitations and contrad ictions of bourgeois society, Marx strives for a society in which 
conflicting class interests have been re solved by the elimination of the social basis of 
classes.  
 (11) The philosophers have merely interpreted the world differently; 
everything depends, h owever, on transforming  it. 
Mere interpretation is not to be replaced by mere activity; the two moments gain new 
meaning from a pervasive unity. The initial phase of demythologizing is motivated by 
a critical suspicion that the best of all possible worlds is a bitter struggle away, a 
suspicion which seeks a different interpretation of the world in the hopes that its specifics will point the way to a social transformation and help rally the necessary 
forces. The initial step of interpretation is therefore cr ucial. From it must follow the 
self-education of the revolutionaries: a theory of the society to be transformed: 
ideological weapons for the causes and a strategy based upon immanent potentials of 
both the process of change and the establish ment of a bett er world. To accomplish 
these tasks coher ently and powerfully, the ideology critique cannot be arbitrary. 
Critical thought must burrow into the core of the social world, contemporary practice, 
the production of daily social existence, the creation of comm odities and the 
reinforcement of the commodity mode of production.  
The unity of theory and practice in Marx’s work is not the subjugation of thought to 
political activism. Practice involves above all the production of material goods, but 
also the reproduct ion of social relations (including the relations of production), 
attitudes, legal order, military defense, etc. Capital , a theoretical work, stands in a unity 
with the practice of nineteenth century European society in a number or ways:  
 (a) It is a reflec tion upon that practice, bringing people to a comprehension of the 
practice in which they are involved.  
 (b) Thereby, it is part of that practice itself, the self -conscious moment.  
 (c) It is conditioned by that practice, which provides its motivation and possibility in 
many ways.  
 (d) Its goal is to restructure that practice by pointing to structural contradictions and 
potentials for change.  
 (e) In these mediated, namely theoretical, ways, Capital  is a political act.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  72 
By focusing on the realm of production , Marx was able to concretize each of these 
points of unity in terms of the proletariat, thereby arriving at a concrete theory of the 
potential for transforming the world in terms of a revolutionary subject -object of 
theoretically informed transformative p ractice.  
Marx believed that every social theory is conditioned by its social context, so that for every interpretation of the world there is a relation and interpenetration of theory and 
practice. Marx’s own approach differs from others – whether contractu al, idealistic or 
scientistic – in that his consciousness of this relation led him to unify his theory and 
social practice by constructing his methodology primarily in terms of this relation. 
Recognizing that his manner of abstraction and his central categ ories had their 
conditions of possibility in the society whose structure they were designed to 
articulate, Marx could clearly define the socio -historical specificity of his concepts and 
he could perceive their interrelationships in terms of the structure o f bourgeois 
society. Above all, Marx’s critical thrust was a conscious response to the social 
mystification arising from the fetishism of commodities; it is as a conscious response 
to the ideological character of capitalist society that Marx transforms phi losophy into 
ideology critique and the critique of political economy. The following chapters explore the result of this transformation of philosophical interpretation of the world into 
transformative interpretation, the critical hermeneutic of capitalist s ociety.

Chapter V. Research: The 
Grundrisse 
The first two dozen pages of the Grundrisse, the notes and rough drafts of Marx’s 
economic studies, which were later published within a more restricted scope in Capital , 
provide an extended treatment of Marx’s me thod. Valuable discussions of the 
following three issues can be found in this “Introduction,” which guided Marx’s 
economic research: (1) the centrality of commodity production, (2) the method of 
analyzing capitalist society, and (3) the relationship of tra nshistorically general to 
socio -historically specific concepts.  
The important chapter of Marx’s Grundrisse entitled “Forms which Precede Capitalist 
Production. (Concerning the Process which Precedes the Formation of the Capitalist 
Relations of Original Acc umulation)” elaborates upon several themes presented in 
the “Introduction.” The forty pages of this chapter contain the only extended 
consideration of pre -capitalist societies in the thousand pages of analysis, yet here 
Marx actually becomes repetitive. In  the formulations of his reconstructive approach 
to history and in his historical characterization of the notion of property, so important 
are they to his concerns. Marx’s reconstruction of the history of property relations, 
understood in their relation to  the prevailing mode or production provides a unity to 
Marx’s doctrines, presents the core of his historical materialism, and supplies the 
critical fulcrum for his critique of political economy.  
Materialistic Conceptualizations for the Self -
Interpretation of the World  
Marx’s statement of the priority of the category of production within an economic 
analysis of bourgeois society is so straightforward that it requires little comment. He 
begins his analysis of the general relations of production to distributio n, exchange, 
and consumption by giving the traditional definitions of these terms as used by 
bourgeois economists (Smith, Ricardo, Mill, etc.):  
The obvious notion: in production  the members of society appropriate 
(create, shape) the products of nature in a ccord with human needs; 
distribution  determines the proportion in which the individual shares 
in the product; exchange delivers the particular products into which 
Marx and Heidegger  
  74 
the individual desires to convert the portion. which distribution has 
assigned to him; and finally, in consumption , the products become 
objects of gratification, of individual appropriation . . .. Thus,  
production  appears as the point of departure, consumption  as the 
conclusion, distribution  and exchange as the middle, which is, however, 
itself twofold , since  distribution is determined by society and 
exchange by individuals.41 
The four basic spheres of the capitalist economy are posited by bourgeois political economy as autonomous domains to be found in every economic system. Marx’s 
analysis is dial ectical, negating the theoretical limitations involved in viewing these 
domains as autonomous by explicating their conceptual, structural and historical 
interdependence, finally arriving at production as in each case the historically 
determinant and determ ining essence behind the multiple appearances. Appealing to 
the traditional definitions just stated (e.g., consumption as appropriation of the object 
by the individual). Marx develops the relation of each domain to production in a strikingly Hegelian style . Concerning production and consumption, he thus argues:  
Production is also immediately consumption. Twofold consumption 
subjective and objective: the individual not only develops his abilities 
in production, but also expands them, uses them up in the act of 
production, just as natural procreation is a consumption of life 
forces. Secondly: consumption of the means of production, which 
become worn out through use, and are partly (e.g., in combustion) 
dissolved into their elements again. Likewise, consumption  of the 
raw material, which loses its natural form and composition by being used up. The act of production is therefore in all its moments an act 
of consumption . . .. The artistic object – like every other product – 
creates a public which is sensitive to a rt and enjoys beauty. 
Production thus not only creates an object for the subject, but also 
a subject for the object . . .. The important thing to recognize here is 
only that, whether production and consumption are viewed as the activity of one or of many in dividuals, they appear in any case as

  75 
moments of one process, in which production is the real point of 
departure and hence also the predominant moment.42 
In the case of production for immediate consumption, the economist’s “state of 
nature,” production is decisive. However, commodity production is by definition 
mediated by distribution. Marx therefore turns next to the relation of this latter sphere to production, in order to
 see what changes this added complication may introduce 
to the centrality of production:  
An individual whose participation in production takes the form of 
wage labor will receive a share in the products, the results of 
production, in the form of wages. The structure of distribution is 
entirely determined by the structure of product ion. Distribution 
itself is a product of production, not only in its object, in that only 
the results of production can be distributed, but also in its form, in 
that the specific kind of participation  in production  determines  the specific forms 
of distribu tion, i.e., the pattern of participation in distribution. It is 
altogether an illusion to posit land in prod uction, ground rent in 
distribution, etc. . . . In the shallowest conception, distribution 
appears as the distribution of products, and hence as fu rthest 
removed from and quasi -independent of production. But before 
distribution can be distribution of products, it is (1) the distribution 
of the members of society among the different kinds of production. 
(Subsumption of the individuals under specific r elations of 
production.) The distribution of products is evidently only a result of this distribution, which is comprised within the process of 
production itself and determines the structure of production . . .. The 
question of the relation between this pro duction determining 
distribution, and production, belongs evidently within production 
itself. If it is said that, since production must begin with a certain 
distribution of the instruments of production, it follows that 
distribution at least in this sense precedes and forms the 
presupposition of production, then the reply must be that production does indeed have its determinants and preconditions 
which form its moments. At the very beginning these may appear as 
spontaneous, natural. But by the process of production itself they 
are transformed from natural into historic determinants, and if they 
appear to one epoch as natural presuppositions of production, they 
were its historic product for another.

Marx and Heidegger  
  76 
Working with an initially “ahistorical” concept of distrib ution, that is, a concept which 
had not previously been subjected to historical reflection, Marx points to its role in 
the historic process and shows how its form is determined by its socio -historical 
position. In capitalist society, for instance, distribu tion takes the form of wages and 
profit – a mode of distribution which is determined in its general form and specific 
contents by the relations of production, the social division of labor into alienated wage labor and private ownership of the means of production.  
Exchange, one of whose phases is circulation, is itself simply an intermediary phase 
between production and distribution and consumption. As these latter domains are 
essentially determined by production in its broader sense, exchange is easily seen  to 
stand in a similar relation to production:  
Exchange appears as independent of and indifferent to production 
only in the final phase where the product is exchanged directly for 
consumption. But (1) there is no exchange without division of labor, 
whether the latter is spontaneous, natural, or already a product of 
historic development, (2) private property presupposes private 
production, (3) the intensity of exchange, as well as its extension and 
its manner, are determined by the development and str ucture of 
production. For example, exchange between town and country; 
exchange in the country, in the town, etc. Exchange in all its 
moments thus appears as either directly comprised in production or 
determined by it.
44 
Marx accordingly concludes this sect ion of his “Introduction” with a statement of the 
priority of production:  
A definite production thus determines a definite consumption, 
distribution and exchange as well as definite relations between these 
different  moments . Admittedly, however, in its one-sided form, production 
is itself determined by the other moments.45 
A number of comments are appropriate here:  
(a) Marx’s conclusion about production is of extreme methodological import. An 
analysis of a given economic system must, according to the argume nt, begin in the 
realm of production, proceeding to an analysis of the remaining economic domains only on the basis of insights gained from an understanding of the mode of production 
(e.g., production of tribal value, of immediate use value, or, in capital ism, of 
commodities). Any other analytic approach cannot capture the uniqueness of the 
economic categories in the given structure because their specificity is founded in the 
 
44 Ibid., p. 99, S. 20.  
45 Ibid. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  77 
specific mode of production. An analysis of capitalism that is interested in uncov ering 
the differences from previous and from potentially future economic systems must 
begin with an analysis of commodity production.  
(b) Marx has distinguished “specific” concepts from “general.” The definitions of 
production, distribution, exchange and c onsumption that Marx borrowed from 
traditional political economists as his starting point represent general concepts, presumed applicable to the description of any system of social institutions which 
responds to the human condition. Specific concepts, by c ontrast, state the difference 
between, for instance, feudal distribution (tribute, alms, etc.) and capitalist distribution (wages, rent, interest). Each of these specific concepts points back to the 
corresponding specific concept of production: feudal agri cultural production or 
capitalist commodity production. (Cf. the following section.)  
(c) All roads led to Rome in the Roman Empire and all approaches to the capitalist 
system lead inevitably to capitalist production, provided only that one perseveres. Of 
course, not all empires radiate out from as absolute a center as Rome, and not all 
social systems are as tightly integrated and dependent upon the realm of production as those with capitalist relations. Only in capitalist society does the distribution of 
goods follow from the role in production according to strict mathematical calculation 
(wages based upon labor time). Previously, hereditary ties, social hierarchy and a host 
of other non -rational considerations mediated the relationship of distribution to 
production. For the future, too, Marx hopes for a society in which there is a relative 
autonomy for each domain, so that each could respond to the criteria peculiar to it 
alone, escaping from restrictions imposed by the mode of production. The 
communist slog an, from each according to his ability; to each according to his needs,” 
formulates precisely the non -identity which transcends the inhuman limitations of 
capitalism. Marx’s argument for the centrality of production in economic relations is 
thus of special relevance to a theory of capitalist society, a social system which 
ruthlessly imposes economic categories on all realms of life. In rejecting the ahistorical character of economic concepts, Marx consciously situates his theory – inclusive of 
its philosoph ical foundations – in its historical setting. In capitalism, the productive 
sphere attains a clear priority. Economics rules all spheres of society. Labor as free 
labor becomes labor -as-such, “abstract labor.” Thereby production, as commodity 
production, b ecomes production -as-such, abstract production. Retrospectively, we 
can then view human labor as the universal source of creation. Similarly, production 
– always tautologically a precondition of social existence – can then retrospectively be 
viewed as the essential realm for the analysis of every society. Thereby, the dialectic 
of forces and relations of production – which is always part of social mediations,  but 
which has its paradigm instance in the industrial revolution where it constitutes the 
essence o f the social development –  can also be extended retrospectively throughout 
history. Capitalist social structures are a key to less developed ones in which forces other than production (religion, politics, etc.) may have obscured the role of 
production. The  point of such retrospective views is primarily to shed light on 
Marx and Heidegger  
  78 
capitalist structures in terms of their prehistory, rather than to understand previous 
societies on their own terms. Within this project the retrospective universality is 
undogmatic. (This ar gument will be substantiated in the final section of Chapter V in 
terms of Marx’s texts.)  
Marx’s is an essentially dialectical and historical science. Despite important differences with them, Marx clearly chose Hegel and Darwin as partial models of scientific 
method. In his “Introduction” to the Grundrisse he both elaborates upon Hegel’s 
opposition of the form of research  to that of presentation and uses the notion that “the 
anatomy of man is a key to the anatomy of the ape.”  
Hegel’s distinction has been reviewed in terms of a dis cussion in Hegel’s History  of 
Philosophy and related to Marx’s method elsewhere.
46 The distinction – foreshadowed 
at least by Kant in his own way in the contrast of the “regressive” approach of the 
Prolegomena  or Foundations  compared to the “synthetic” approach of the first and 
second Critique s – can also be seen at work in the relation of Hegel’s Phenomenology  of 
Mind  to his Science of Logic.47 One can, that is, view the Phenomenology  as the record of a 
research which traces the development of mind quasi -historically from its beginnings 
in sense -perception to its culmination in absolute spirit. The Science of Logic starts then 
from Being as the (sublimated) conceptual representation of absolute spirit and 
proceeds to unfold this concept systematically to account for all categories of mind. 
Whereas the Phenomenology , so viewed, would illustrate the form of research , parall eling 
a more commonsensical or naturally historical progression, the Logic would illustrate 
the form of presentation, proceeding from a central concept and logically deriving the 
entire science from it. Rejecting Hegel’s emphasis on the realm of mind, Marx  retains 
Hegel’s critique of empiricism, of the view that science consists in subsuming cases 
under classifications that have merely pragmatic signi ficance. The point for Marx is 
to get at the essence of the matter (capitalism) by a process of research th at begins  
with the obvious appearances, but then to present the matter systematically, 
comprehended in terms of its essence. We have already seen this notion of 
comprehension at work in the manuscript on alienated labor, where Marx criticized 
political eco nomy for not grasping the essential connections between their concepts. 
Later, we shall see how Capital  embodies Marx’s conception of a dialectical science of 
society. First, however, we must look at Marx’s development of this ideal.  
Marx begins by critici zing the common -sense assumption that “it seems to be correct 
to start with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to begin, in 
economics with e.g., the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the 
 
46 Alfred Schmidt, Geschichte und Struktur  (München: Hanser, 1971), S. 52ff.  
47 Cf. G. W. F. Hegel, “With what must science begin?” and “Introduction,” both in 
his Science of Logic . 
Marx and Heidegger  
  79 
entire social act of pr oduction.”48 Marx rejects population as a concrete element, 
claiming that it is in fact an abstract notion, a representation which overlooks the 
essential features of population, such as class structure. Population cannot be used as 
the starting point for an interpretive theory of society, for its concreteness is merely 
apparent simplistic, hence false. The notion of population may, however, suggest itself as the starting point of an investigation leading to the interpretive essence: “If I were 
to begin wit h population, it would be a chaotic representation of the whole and 
through closer determination I would arrive analytically at increasingly simple concepts; from the represented concrete to thinner and thinner abstractions until I 
reached the simplest det erminations.”
49 One must, that is, in Walter Benjamin’s 
phrase, “transverse the icy wasteland of abstraction in order to arrive conclusively at concrete philosophizing.”
50 
The investigation of population in terms of classes and of these in terms of the fac tors 
which define them – wage labor, capital, commodities, surplus value, etc. – leads to 
concepts like exchange value, which are theoretical constructs abstracted from the 
social process. Using such conceptually simple terms, one can then analyze complex 
phenomena coherently and systematically. The research moves from appearance to 
essence, from the imaginary concrete to the abstractly simple, and then back again: 
“From there it would be necessary to make the journey again in the opposite direction 
until I  had finally arrived once more at the population, but this time not as the chaotic 
representation of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and restrictions.”
51 The return journey is the systematic presentation. It moves from the 
“simple,” “abstract,” essential, theoretical concepts such as value back to the complex 
phenomena such as population – now replacing the seemingly concrete rational mass 
with a truly concrete totality, conceptually analyzed as, say, a system of classes, understood i n terms of their positions in the process of production.  
The image of the round -trip journey can help us follow Marx’s progress beyond 
bourgeois political economy, as he viewed it, recognizing, of course, that this attempt to apply the distinction of research and presentation is grossly simplistic and can hope 
only to be suggestive. The trip begins with “vulgar” political economy, those writings 
which accepted the necessary illusions projected by the capitalist system and 
propagated them to ideological ends . Based on the realm of exchange, these theories 
used the ideology of just exchange to claim that capitalism was natural, rational and

the final stage of history. “Classical” political economy (Petty, Smith, Ricardo, etc.) 
made tremendous strides along the  research route, reaching the insight into the 
centrality of production (labor) and formulating a labor theory of value. In his own 
economic studies, preserved primarily in the Grundrisse and the Theories of Surplus  Value , 
Marx followed the progress of the  classical theorists, clarifying meta physical 
confusions, developing his own accounts of the commodity and surplus value and, 
above all, placing the whole in a radically historical context. Then in Capital , the 
explicitly scientific return trip, Marx started from the abstract simples, commodity and 
surplus value, to develop a systematic account of capitalism, beginning in Volume I 
with the essential realm of production.  
The continuous dialectical motion of anticipation, research and presentation or of 
vague image, abstract concept and concrete articulation is, in the first approximation, 
very common. It involves tentatively constructing an interpretation of some subject 
matter while investigating it, later revising the interpretation in light of new fin dings. 
First impressions on meeting someone is an instance of projecting a personality 
structure onto a set of behavior, allowing for subsequent reinterpretation on the basis 
of increased familiarity. Heidegger has conceptualized this in connection with th e 
problem of becoming familiar with Being in terms of pre -understanding, the fore -
structure of understanding, the hermeneutic circle, and the relationship of Being and 
Time to his later works. If Heidegger were now to give a presentation as systematic as 
Being and Time of his research – the questioning of Being – many elements of his 
various studies would be present but false leads and faulty aspects would be 
suppressed as irrelevant (except insofar as their failures had an insightful necessity). 
So, too, i n Marx’s case, many concepts and considerations of the early inquiries, 
critiques and self -clarifications appear in Capital  – so much so that commentators 
often claim that Marx’s mature outlook or even his economic system were already 
worked out in the ver y early man uscripts. However, in the final presentation many of 
the accidental emphases stemming from Marx’s biography rather than from the nature of capitalism have been dropped, details filled in, insights deepened, concepts greatly 
developed, interconnections systematically drawn, and a coherence impressed upon 
the whole.  
The process  of theory -building allows the presentation to be appropriate to the object 
of the research and the abstract concept to be appropriate to the articulation of the 
concrete ph enomenon. Although there is a unity of preconception, analysis and 
systematization, the mediating conceptual framework is not determined in advance. 
Marx began with the concepts which had already grown out of political economic 
research. As self -articulations of bourgeois society, these concepts were both 
suggestions for an appropriate conceptual scheme and symptoms of the self -
mystifying power of commodity relations. Marx criticized the deviations of the 
concepts from the present economic reality and great ly developed their specificity, 
interconnections and content in the course of his own research. Not predetermined, the conceptual framework does not come only at the end of the research, through 
Marx and Heidegger  
  81 
induction. The research cannot proceed without concepts, but is itself the process of 
searching for, testing and criticizing interpretive concepts. Only the concepts can 
determine what counts as a fact, as a concrete social phenomenon. Empirically 
observable and statistically calculable facts have already been media ted in reality by social 
forces and only their mediation  by abstract  concepts  in reflection (theory, analysis) can uncover 
this, their essential character. Concepts and facts cannot be thought without each 
other. Each abstraction must be developed in the p rocess of research, a process which 
can only thereby lead to a more complete, concrete grasp of its object. The systematic presentation then consists merely of a retrospective view of the research, organized 
in accordance with the results of the research. The dialectical unity of presentation 
and research assures that the interpretive system treats its object as unique, as socio -
historically specific.  
Because Marx resists imposing an a priori  system upon his research, but develops his 
analytic terms out of  the ‘thing itself” as  it presents itself in the research, Marx’s 
method must be considered more hermeneutical  than metaphysical . Hermeneutics, as the 
art of interpretation, characteristically comes to the fore when interpretation has 
become prob lematic, and this is certainly the case with Marx’s object. The fetishism 
of commodities has obscured the social relations definitive of bourgeois society, turning naive theories of society into socially necessary illusion: ideology. Marx’s task 
is thus typical for  the hermeneute, namely, to interpret the given as false or distorted 
solely on the basis of that given itself, without imposing an external interpretive scheme. The relationship of his research to his presentation is one aspect of Marx’s 
response to this task.  
Research into bourgeois society as a whole should, if allowed to develop fully, 
eventually come upon the concepts of commodity, value, etc. regardless of its starting 
point. Scientific analysis  of specific phenomena must, on the other hand, begin wit h 
the proper concepts to reach an understanding of the phenomena within the structure 
of society. The essential concepts depend on the form of society, on the form of 
production which stands at the center of society.  
Marx’s position is thus strictly oppose d to an ahistorical approach which seeks to 
deduce the character of the present from an absolute origin. He is opposed to the 
idealist goal of an unconditioned prima  philosophia  which proceeds from an indubitable 
truth like Descartes’ cogito sum or Hegel’s  sense -certainty and immediate Being. The 
essence of the present is to be found in the present, not in some imaginary or even 
real past where that essence may have existed in some undeveloped and peripheral 
form.  
For instance, nothing seems more natural th an to begin with ground 
rent, with landed property, since this is bound up with the earth, the 
source of all production and of all being, and with the first form of 
production of all more or less settled societies – agriculture. But 
nothing would be more m istaken. In all forms of society there is a 
Marx and Heidegger  
  82 
specific branch of production which determines the stature and 
influence of all the other branches, whose relations do this for the 
relations of all the other branches. There is a pervasive illumin ation 
in which  all other colors are bathed, and which modifies them in 
their specifics.52 
In agricultural society, for instance, the crafts and industries that are present in a crude 
state adopt the characteristics of agricultural relations: the immediate relationship t o 
specific human needs; organization of property, knowledge and roles along hereditary lines; and so forth. In capitalist society, the opposite takes place: even agriculture 
becomes a commodity industry.  
Just as delimited analyses of particular social phenomena in the capitalist era must rely 
upon the central categories of capitalist production, so a presentation of the whole 
social system must begin with them. It would therefore be unfeasible and wrong to 
let the economic categories follow one another in t he same sequence as that in which 
they were historically decisive. Their sequence is determined, rather, by their relation to one another in modern bourgeois society, which is precisely the opposite of that 
which seems to be their natural order, or which c orresponds to historical 
development.
53 
The economic categories are thus interrelated in several ways: in terms of the existing social system, according to their historical development and in a natural or logical 
order. Darwin’s theory of the origin of man provides an analogy to this situation. 
Suppose one asked about man’s prehensile thumb. The naively historical analysis might point out that first fish developed protruding gills, then mammals acquired 
limbs with fingered hands and finally the primate f amily evolved the opposable 
thumb, which we have inherited. Someone with more awareness of epistemological 
issues could, like Marx, add a twist: “The intimations of higher development among the subordinate animal species, however, can be understood only af ter the higher 
development is already known.”
54 The claim that modern man’s thumb is the telos of 
the prehistoric gill is not based on religious faith, but on a perspective shared by the 
Hegelian owl of Minerva: the present. In taking human anatomy as the key to that of 
the ape – bourgeois economy as the key to the economy of antiquity – Marx’s 
historical approach is radically reconstructive , as opposed to naively constructive 
historiology. Marx carries out his reconstruction of pre -capitalist economic 
form ations on the basis of his knowledge of their telos as now actualized in bourgeois 
society. (Cf. the section on Marx’s retrospective history of property relations.)

  83 
By deriving the succession of his categories from the relation they have in bourgeois 
socie ty, Marx avoids the traditional dilemma of philosophy up to Hegel. Hegel, that 
is, had already made theory and history relative to each other in dialectical fashion, 
but for him this meant either filling the logical sequence of the categories with a wealth  
of historical material or else rationalizing (sublimating, abstracting) actual history into the shape of a sequence of forms. Marx’s radical unity of theory and history has no 
need for these imposed techniques. The critique of political economy, as the cr itical 
theory of bourgeois society, abolishes the duality of philosophy and historical analysis by discovering the entire history of the categories and forms of social existence in 
present society. Conversely, as critical, Marx’s theory rejects the facade of immediacy 
in given appearances by presenting their concrete historical genesis. It dissolves or 
“de-constructs” the mystifying process of reification and fetishization by inquiring 
after the social and historical conditions and presuppositions of presen t-day 
appearances and concepts. If Marx’s concepts are reflections of bourgeois society, 
they have also been critically transformed in the recog nition that the conceptual 
mirror is systematically warped by the fetishism of commodities. Through this form of appropriation of the given categories – determined by socio- historically specific 
considerations already based on his theory – Marx avoids the ideological thrust of 
those theories which lack such a conscious unity of theory and practice.  
Marx’s historical method of analysis had important consequences for his manner of 
forming concepts as well. Through the historical character of his con ceptualizations, 
Marx avoided the problems created by the “vulgar” and the “classical” political economists due to their  unreflected perspective on history. While Marx agrees that 
previous social forms are to be under stood from the perspective of bourgeois society 
– viewing history as leading up to capitalism and using the economic concepts of 
capitalism as analytic tools – he insists that the differences between that which the 
concepts denoted then and now not be over -looked. It is, he thinks, quite impossible 
to use the present system as a key to preceding formations if one tries to do this:  
in the manner of those econom ists who obliterate all historical 
differences and who see in all forms of society only bourgeois 
relations. If one is acquainted with ground rent, one can understand 
tribute, tithe, etc. But they do not have to be treated as identical . . .. 
Thus, although  it is true that the categories of bourgeois economics 
possess a truth for all other forms of society, this has to be taken cum 
grano salis. They may contain them in a developed, stunted or 
caricatured, etc., form, but always with an essential difference.
55 
The general concept, rent, is valid for all or at least many social systems, but, on the 
other hand, the specific concept of bourgeois rent is essentially different from feudal 
rent (tithe) or classical rent (tribute). The common confusion among politica l 
 
55 Ibid., p. 105f, S. 26.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  84 
economists between the generality and specificity of their concepts deserves extended 
consideration and the present text is perhaps the most explicit of Marx’s writings on 
this point. (Cf. the following section.)  
Marx’s thought is historical in yet anoth er way. In addition to viewing social 
phenomena as developments in a retrospectively historical manner and clarifying the socio -historical specificity of his concepts, Marx relates his work to the present state 
of society, to the strivings of social groups . Highly conscious of the fact that his theory 
is situated in the bourgeois era, Marx does not make a fetish of capitalism as though 
it were necessarily the final stage of historical progress. Clearly, his intent is  quite the 
opposite, and the subjective i ntent is objectively embodied in the theory’s structure, 
providing its unity of theoretical and political practice. Further, the possibility of embedding his revolutionary intent in economic theory has its foundation in the 
reality of the class struggle:  
 The so- called historical presentation of development is founded, as 
a rule, on the fact that the latest form regards the previous ones as 
steps leading up to itself, and, since it is only rarely and only under 
quite special conditions able to criticize its elf – leaving aside, of 
course, the historical periods which appear to them selves as times of 
decadence –  it always conceives them one -sided.
56 
The important and intriguing “Afterword” (1873) to the second German edition of 
Capital  clearly demonstrates ho w important the relationship of the social context 
(working class consciousness, academic theories and ideologies, economic crises) to Capital  was for its author. Marx sees the revolutionary character of his dialectical 
method in the fact that it treats th e present stage as not only the progressive 
culmination of the past, but also as a contradictory and repressive system which is, 
however, in the process of transcending itself towards the future:  
In its rational form dialectics is a scandal and abominatio n to 
bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors because it includes in 
its comprehension an affirmative recognition of the negation of that 
state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every 
historically developed social form as in fluid motio n, and therefore 
takes into account its transitory nature not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and it is in its 
essence critical and revolutionary.

Historically specific  Conceptualizations  
Production is always pr oduction of a particular product, by a particular worker, with 
particular means in a particular social context; the concept of production must take 
this into account. Not one to pull his con ceptual punches, Marx opens the 
“Introduction” to his critique of  political economy in the Grundrisse with an immediate 
consideration of this aspect of his central category: production. His first line makes 
clear that he uses this term in an historically or socially specific sense; “material 
production” refers to produc tive forms specific to a particular historical period or to 
particular branches of production, not to production in general or general production: “The object before us is, to begin with, material  production . Individuals producing in 
society – hence socia lly determined production of individuals – is, of course, the point 
of departure.”
58 The production which keeps society going is production within 
society, determined by the character of the particular society, carried out by agents 
acting in socially defi ned roles.  
What of someone who today produces, say, pottery the way it has been produced by 
hand in the most varied societies? Firstly, it is undoubtedly done as a hobby or art 
form, outside the concerns of society and primarily for personal enjoyment and 
expression. Further, it most likely uses modern technology: chemically pure glazes or 
an electric kiln – especially if there is some hope of competing with factory -produced 
ceramics. And clearly the aesthetic sensibility at work will be in the end peculiar ly 
modern (especially, again, if there is an appeal to a buying public), perhaps a reaction 
against the con sequences of mass production.  
Additionally, Marx argues, the very possibility of producing as an individual – 
developing a superfluous hobby outside of the socially efficient forms of produc tion 
– is itself a product of history, of social and productive development to the point 
where workers have free time. Marx takes the novel about Robinson Crusoe, a totally 
eighteenth -century British gentleman par ading as nature boy, as a typical example of 
the ideology of individualism. He points out that the individual, both as a category and as a mode of existence, is peculiarly bourgeois, a result of the historical 
developments leading to capitalism. Against the bourgeois projection of the concept 
of the individual back to the nomadic or tribal beginnings of history, Marx notes that 
the biological human entity was part of a social grouping or social formation out of 
which and on whose basis alone it could define itself individually. The argument 
extends Hegel’s dialectic of mutual recognition and anticipates Wittgenstein’s 
rejection of private languages, stressing that individualism is essentially (biologically 
and historically) social, not “natural”: 
 
58 “Introduction,” Grundrisse, p. 83, S. 5.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  86 
The more de eply we go back into history, the more does the 
individual, and hence also the producing individual, appear as 
dependent, as belonging to a greater whole; in a still quite natural 
way in the family and in the family expanded into the clan; then later 
in the various forms of communal society arising  out of the 
antitheses and fusions of the clans. Only in the eighteenth century, in bourgeois society, do the various forms of social connectedness 
confront the individual as a mere means towards his private 
purpo ses, as external necessity. But the epoch which produces this 
standpoint, that of the isolated individual, is also precisely that of the 
hitherto most developed social (from this standpoint, general) 
relations. The human being is in the most literal sense  a zoon politikon , 
a political animal, not merely a greg arious animal, but an animal 
which can individuate itself only in the midst of society. Production 
by an isolated individual outside society – a rare exception which 
may well occur when a civilized p erson in whom the social forces 
are already dynamically present is cast by accident into the wilderness 
– is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language 
without individuals living together and talking to one another.
59 
Consequently, the two a historical approaches to defining production are equally 
unacceptable; the proper approach lies between the extremes. The idealist definition 
of production as the forming of the object by a subject with the aid of a mediating 
tool completely misses the par ticularity of object, subject and tool as belonging to an 
historical stage and a social system. The nominalist definition, on the other hand, misses the common element of instances of production within a given socio -historical 
context as well as obscuring the underlying fact that subject, object and tool are 
already results of historical and social processes. Production as the mediation of 
individual subject and natural object is itself as much mediated by society as are its 
two poles. Production takes plac e within one social context or another and is 
essentially defined by the society’s specifics. Even the rare cases of individuals 
producing outside the social norms (castaways, hermits, artists) are merely exceptions that prove the rule in that their deviat ions presuppose the norm.  
The conclusion for a theory of capitalist society is that the concept of production 
must always be in terms of the specific concepts of production appropriate to specific 
societies, e.g., commodity production in bourgeois society.  Marx draws this 
conclusion, excluding the notion of the conceptual priority of production -in-general:  
Whenever we speak of production, then, we always have in mind 
production at a definite stage of social development – production by 
individuals in a socie ty. It might therefore seem that, in order to 
 
59 Ibid., p. 84, S. 6.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  87 
speak of production at all we must either trace the various phases in 
the historical process of development or else declare beforehand that 
we are dealing with a specific historic epoch such as, e.g., modern 
bourgeois production, which is indeed our particular theme.60 
Marx does leave room for the concept of production -in-general – neither socially nor 
historically specific – but his way of doing this shows why the particular  concepts of 
production have a priority, rather than legitimating the liberal ideology which expl oits 
general concepts as ahistorical. His characterization of the universal genus, similar to 
Wittgenstein’s notion of family resemblance, seems strikingly positivistic.  
All periods of production have, however, certain common traits, common characteristics . Production in general is an abstraction, but a 
rational abstrac tion in so far as it really brings out and fixes the 
common element and thus avoids repetition . . .. Some 
determinations belong to all epochs, others only to a few. The most modern epoch and  the most ancient will share (some) 
determinations.
61 
Of course, Marx is by no means a positivist: he is merely choosing his level of 
abstraction on the basis of  the nature of his subject matter, rejecting the extremes of 
ahistorical abstraction and positivistic data collection, but synthesizing what is 
valuable or critical in each of the approaches by developing his theory with 
abstractions which are filled with content: specific concepts. Categories like 
commodity production allow Marx to work out a dialectically scientific theory of the 
essential structure of the capitalist system, while simultaneously allowing him to 
distinguish what is necessary to the reprodu ction of mankind in its dialectic with 
nature and what is merely imposed. Such categories are crucial to practical philosophy, to transformative interpretation, to critical theory.  
A general concept such as production in general, as Marx uses it, is differ ent from the 
ahistorical  concepts of bourgeois political economy in that it is the result of historical 
reflection, a synthesis of specific concepts of production or a summary of what is 
common to the specific concepts. In this form, general concepts play an important 
role in Marx’s theory – not on their own as metaphysical preconceptions, but in the 
contrast with their specific sub -concepts. Of course, this is strictly speaking true only 
in Capital , Marx’s developed and systematic presentation. In his earl y manuscripts, 
terms occasionally appear in an ahistorical form anticipating the general concepts 
which will subsequently result from historical analysis, a more highly developed 
systematic context and a more extensive critique. However, even these early 
occurrences are results of specific negation of idealistic or ideological outlooks in 
 
60 Ibid., p. 85, S. 6f.  
61 Ibid., p. 85, S. 7.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  88 
terms of social and historical considerations, and thus Marx’s usages are less 
ahistorical than they might appear.  
Marx uses one of his favorite analogies, that of languag e to production, to point out 
the critical necessity of contrasting the specific with the general concept. He notes 
that although the most highly developed languages have laws and characteristics in 
common with the least developed languages, it is precisel y their divergences from 
these general and common elements which determine their devel opment.62 Language, 
as a medium for interpersonal commun ication, has certain necessary elements which 
all languages have shared. But there is a second set of elements t o be discovered in 
any actual language which are not necessary to the task of human communication,  
and which may actually restrict the freedom of expression. Progress in the evolution of language, then, consists partially in rejecting these restrictive fea tures.
63 
The analogy applies directly to the specific concepts of production, so that the socio -
historically specific elements “must be separated out from the determinations valid for production as such, so that in their unity – which arises already from t he identity 
of the subject, humanity, and the object, nature – their essential difference is not 
forgotten.”
64 The notion of “second nature” is helpful here; it refers to conditions or 
institutions which appear natural, necessary, inevitable, but which are  in fact created 
by people, contingent, not necessary. Private property is, for instance, a legal 
institution which has become second nature to us, but which, Marx argues, was – in 
distinction to possession – absent from primitive societies and now acts as  a chain 
upon us, keeping us from a better society in which it would disappear. The general 
concept of production, then, would state what is natural (necessary) to production in 
all ages and all social systems. The difference between the specific concept o f 
bourgeois production and this general concept of production would define bourgeois second nature. The ideology of the capitalist era is largely based on the positing of 
second nature as natural, on assuming that the characteristics peculiar to the bourge ois 
age are eternal, rational and sacred. Only a social theory which distinguishes necessity from second nature and explores the possibilities for eliminating the latter can 
perform the critical function rather than one of blanket justification.  
While the notion of necessity has here been introduced in an ahistorical manner, 
Marx’s notion of the general concept retains historical content; while the necessary 
 
62 Ibid. 
63 Marx’s remarks on language have recently been developed by Apel and Habermas, 
whose theory of communicative competence tries to define those necessary features 
of language in order to distinguish them from the “systematic distortions” which may 
ideologica lly restrict the attempt to use communication to achieve emancipation from 
social relations of domination.  
64 Ibid. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  89 
nature of production can never be diverged from, Marx’s “production -in-general” 
merely has not yet b een diverged from. Marx’s parenthetical remark that the generality 
can be understood by merely noting that production always involves humanity and 
nature, thus retaining a minimal invariant content, suggests an ahistorical side -glance 
at the necessary stru cture. But his remark has the character of a tautological aside and 
he does retain his historical definition of general concepts throughout. The ahistorical, 
almost tautological side- glance appears as a moment of abstraction from  history 
within a discussio n focused on history. Marx is well aware that neither the subject (the 
worker) nor the object (nature) of the production process remains invariant thr ough 
the history of the modes of production. But the abstraction which allows us to identity 
the poles of production with the terms “humanity” and “nature” also allows us briefly 
to posit the unity of production -as-such – in order thereby to determine the historical 
differentia  specifica  of particular modes of production.  
Marx’s revolutionary anticipations of a society without certain elements of bourgeois 
second nature do not, therefore, rest on speculation about the true nature  or essence 
or human production as on a metaphysical first principle, but on an historical 
argument, namely that those institutions wh ich are second nature to us now did not 
exist at certain periods in human history and therefore are not necessary to human life and may con ceivably be eliminated in the future. This argument certainly does not 
in itself prove that alienated labor or priva te property will inevitably disappear or even 
that the benefits of capitalism could be maintained without the undesirable aspects of 
capitalist second nature. It is primarily an argument against the outlook of bourgeois 
political economy which took feature s peculiar to capitalism as unquestionably 
necessary for all societies. Marx’s thought is thus historical not only in the sense that his analytic standpoint is consciously rooted in the present, but also in that his hope 
for the future has its basis in una chieved potentials of the past and present.  
General concepts are historical in another, more striking way than merely as 
summaries of historical instances. The supposedly ahistorical concepts of bourgeois 
political economy – production, labor, property, va lue, etc. – are, according to Marx, 
merely the sublimated expression of the respective specifically bourgeois concepts – 
commodity production, wage labor, private property, labor value, etc. These specific 
concepts are what Marx calls simple categories, as  opposed to what is naively imagined 
to be concrete, like national population.  
Simple categories are historically situated: they presuppose concrete historical 
developments for their very meaning. “For example, the simplest economic category, 
e.g., exchange value, presupposes population, a population moreover which produces 
in specific relations, as well as a distinct kind of family or community or state, etc. 
Exchange value cannot exist except as an abstract, one -sided relation within an already 
given, con crete, living whole.”
65 Marx’s materialism views the concrete social totality, 
 
65 Ibid., p. 101, S. 22.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  90 
which is the result of comprehending the imaginary concrete with abstract simple 
categories, as “a product of the working -up of observation and representation into 
concepts.”66 A certain historical stage must already have been reached and perceived 
before the image of it could have been transformed into the categories which are 
appropriate to its comprehension. Theory does not approach a social formation with 
concepts created thr ough unsituated contemplation: the theory of capitalism, down 
to its simplest and broadest categories, presupposes the historical development of capitalism: “Hence, in the theoretical method, too, the subject, society, must always 
be kept in mind as the pr esupposition.”
67 
The clearest example of the relation of a general to a specific category is that of labor. 
The attempt by Marx’s critics to saddle him with an ontology of labor or a metaphysics 
of homo faber relies upon ignoring the distinctions among the  ideologically ahistorical, 
historically general and specifically bourgeois categories of labor. The particular category of bourgeois labor was formulated by Adam Smith, who “rejected every 
limiting specification of wealth – productive activity – not only manufacturing, or 
commercial, or agricultural labor, but one as well as the others, labor in general.”
68 
The concept of labor -as-such, “abstract labor,” presupposed the social system which 
was in fact establishing itself in Adam Smith’s day. In capitalism  all labor becomes 
equivalent, measured quantitatively by labor -time, regardless of qualitative 
differences. The bourgeois job and labor markets ironed out all differences between 
particular forms of labor or types of workers, transforming labors into labo r as such. 
Smith’s concept expressed his perception of this social development. The fact that the particular type of labor is irrelevant both socially  and conceptually “presupposes 
a highly developed totality of real kinds of labor, of which no single one is any longer 
predominant.”
69 Clearly, the concept of labor -as-such, without restrictions, can be 
applied to labor in all societies universally in retrospect. Thus, the particularly 
bourgeois category becomes simultaneously the general concept of labor.  
Marx’s general concept of labor is, thereby, a consequence of the bourgeois society in 
which he was consciously situated, not the result of metaphysical dogma or an 
ontological faith. It would be a mistake to attribute here to Marx what he criticizes as 
ideological in others: the hypostatization of particular or even general categories into 
ahistorical, necessarily eternal concepts unrelated to the movement of history. Precisely with the concept of labor, Marx makes his points:  
 
66 Ibid.

68 Ibid., p. 104, S. 24.  
69 Ibid., p. 104, S. 25.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  91 
The example of labor shows strikingly how even the most abstract 
categories, despite their validity – precisely because of their 
abstractness – for all epochs, are nevertheless, in the specific 
character of this abstraction, themselves likewise a product of 
historic relations and posses s their full validity only for and within 
those relations. Bourgeois society is the most developed and the most complex historic organization of production. The categories 
which express its relations, the comprehension of its structure, 
thereby also allow insights into the structure and the relations of 
production of all the vanished social formations out of whose ruins 
and elements it built itself up, whose partly still uncovered remnants 
are carried along within it, whose mere nuances have developed 
explicit significance within it, etc.
70 
Abstract categories are products of historic relations. Further, their contradictory 
forms result from social disharmony: use value versus exchange value, private property 
versus social production, particular versus abstr act labor, wages versus surplus values; the 
conceptual tensions reflect class conflicts. Both the actuality of abstract labor and its 
expression in the concept of labor -as-such are products of the development of the 
historic preconditions of commodity production, which requires the severing in 
reality as in consciousness of the ties  of workers to their land, tools, etc. as their own 
property. The concept of labor -as-such, already used by Adam Smith, is the central 
category of Marx’s system, underlying his key analyses of the labor form of value, the 
antagonisms between labor and capi tal, the appropriation of surplus labor and the 
fetishism of the activity and conditions of labor in the products of labor. Marx’s path 
of abstraction from the population of capitalist societies to abstract labor follows the 
well-worn trail of historical d evelopments. Similarly, Marx’s abstractions of 
production, value, etc. were in no way arbitrary, biased or metaphysical. They 
represented the conceptual appropriation of bourgeois social relations, and they knew 
themselves as such in the sense that Marx’s methodology – his path of abstraction 
and concretion, the manifold and reflected unity of his theory and social practice, his 
approach to history, his formation of general and specific concepts – transformed its 
social and historical conditions into its co ntent. Hence the anticipatory character of 
Marx’s abstractions in the early manuscripts: the process of abstraction at work in 
social research is itself guided by social theory. Only in Capital  is the systematic circle 
complete in which the theory of bourg eois society justifies the abstractions which 
present the theory while within that theory the analysis of the fetishism of 
commodities explains the necessity of elaborating such a theory in the face of social 
mystifications.  
 
70 Ibid., p. 105, S. 25.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  92 
A further point in the precedin g quotation concerns the insight gained into pre -
capitalist societies through the theory of capitalist society, which  is the applicability of 
specifically bourgeois concepts to the interpretation of previous social formations. 
This trans -historical validit y of many categories which are historically -specific to the 
present era – in that they were not fully developed and central in previous societies 
and hence were not prominent in the theoretical consciousness of those societies – is 
due to the fact that the  central features of capitalist production, such as commodities, 
exchange, labor and money, were present in society in various forms. It is, of course 
especially useful to view pre -capitalist societies in terms of bourgeois categories when 
trying to unders tand them as stages in the prehistory of capitalism. But even more 
generally, the specific categories of bourgeois society give insight into previous 
societies in their sublimated form as general categories. But the insight is not the 
whole picture, and wh at we are calling sublimation does cause an essential 
transformation.  
An economist might, for example, generalize and say that production always requires an instrument (at least the hand of the worker) and accumulated labor (at least the 
training of a skil led hand). Joining these with a loose notion of capital, he might argue: 
“Capital is, among other things, also an instrument of production, also past, objectified labor. Consequently capital is a general and external relation of nature: that 
is,” as Marx is quick to point out, “provided one omits just the specific quality which 
alone makes instrument  of production  and accumulated labor into capital.”
71 The 
point is that although the specific bourgeois category forms the basis for a general 
concept, there ar e crucial differences that must not be ignored. Labor under capitalism 
may well be conspicuously general in producing without concern for the particulars 
of the job or of the worker, it may clearly be a process of transforming nature into a 
product in orde r to support itself, but it is also wage-labor which does not own the 
preconditions of its labor or the product and which creates exchange- value in return 
for monetary  wages – these latter characteristics differentiating it from all previous 
forms of labor . The specific –  and therefore also the general – categories presuppose 
the historic process, and a study of this process can clarify what distinguishes the 
specific from the general, second nature from the natural. Political economists tend 
to ignore the historical dimension and therefore end up as apologists  for a more 
efficient version of  what already exists anyway. They present production as “encased 
in eternal natural laws independent of history, and at the same time bourgeois relations 
are clandestine ly passed off as inviolable natural laws on which is founded society in 
abstracto .”72 
The study of history often clears up the ideological illusions, not so much because of 
the details of the alternative view it may present, but merely in the fact that it uncovers 
 
71 Ibid., p. 86, S. 7.  
72 Ibid., p. 87, S. 8f.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  93 
the assumptions and maneuvers of the ahistorical approach. Marx uses historical 
knowledge to counter the claim that private property, for instance, is natural or 
necessary. He grants that production is always appropriation of nature, an individual  
taking possession, and thus property is (tautologically) a condition of production. But, 
he counters, “It is quite ridiculous to make a leap from this to a specific form of 
property, e.g., private property. (Which further and equally presupposes an antith etical 
form, non-property .) History shows, rather, common property (e.g., in India, among the 
Slavs, the early Celts, etc.) to be the (more) original form, and in the shape of 
communal property it continues to play a significant role for a long time.”73 This 
argument and the historical analysis of private property are carried out in the section 
of the Grundrisse to which we next turn.  
To recapitulate: There are characteristics which are common to all stages of production,  and which are established by the mi nd as general characteristics; the so -
called general preconditions  of all production, however, are “nothing more than these 
abstract moments with which no real historical stage of production can be grasped.”
74 
Retrospective Interpretation of the History of 
Property Relations  
Marx’s chapter on the “Forms which Precede Capitalist Production”75 is divided into 
two sections: I) an historical reconstruction of the prerequisites for wage labor and II) an 
historical reconstruction of the prerequisites for capital. Schematically, that is, the 
economic system known as capitalism is defined by the relationship of wage -labor 
(embodied in the proletariat) to capital (embodied in the capitalist class), all other 
sectors having a secondary importance defined b y their relation to the two primary 
classes and eventually dissolving into these classes with the progressive development 
and self- purification of the capitalist system, as Marx had already concluded in the 
1844 Manuscripts . 
Whereas the bulk of the Grundri sse is concerned with the conditions  of capitalism, it is 
here the preconditions  or presuppositions which are of interest. Marx had already drawn 
this distinction a few pages earlier in the Grundrisse in a section on primitive 
 
73 Ibid., p. 87f, S. 9.  
74 Ibid., p. 88, S. 10.  
75 Marx’s chapter on “Forms which precede capitalist production” is in the Grundrisse,

accumulation, with the exampl e of the existence of cities. While a city can, as a city, 
reproduce its population, it cannot possibly have itself produced the founding 
population; they must have come from somewhere else. “While, e.g. the flight of 
feudal serfs to the cities is one of t he historic  (pre-) conditions and presuppositions of 
urbanism, it is not a condition , not a moment of the reality of developed cities, but it 
belongs to their past presuppositions, to the prerequisites of their formative process, 
which are suspended in the ir existence.”76 A “condition” of a city is, then, part of its 
permanent structure which insures its continued existence, whereas a 
“presupposition” is some thing that was required for the original creation of the city. 
A presupposition of wage labor is ac cordingly defined as an historical factor or 
development prior to capitalism which allowed for or contributed to the 
transformation of a large portion of the population into wage -laborers. 
Marx opens his chapter by naming two such preconditions of wage -labor: “free -
labor” and the separation or this “freed” labor from the ownership of the means and 
materials of labor:  
If one of the presuppositions of wage labor, and one of the historic preconditions for capital, is free labor and the exchange of this free 
labor for money, in order to reproduce and to realize money, to 
consume the use value of labor not for  individual consumption, but 
as use value for money – then another presupposition is the 
separation of free labor from the objective conditions of its 
realization, from the means of labor and the material for labor. Thus, 
above all, release of the worker from the soil as his natural workshop 
– hence dissolution of small, free landed property as well as of 
communal landownership resting on the oriental commun e.
77 
Marx proceeds to trace through history the relationship of the laborer to the land, the 
instruments, the means of consumption prior to production, and the laborer’s own 
body. He follows these four relationships through tribal (“Oriental”), classical ( Greek 
and Roman city- states), and feudal (“Germanic”) society, treating the 
transformations, weakening and gradual demise of these relationships as a necessary 
prerequisite of capitalism. Originally, the worker, as a tribal member, is related to the 
direct communal property of land as his own. The intermediary stages see various 
combinations of communal and petty land ownership, until finally the laborer must pay rent to a landowner for use of land. The laborer’s relationship to his instruments 
– even in th e feudal guild system still retained along hereditary or craft lines – is finally 
dissolved with the factory system. The patriarchal systems also faded away, which had 
cared for the members of the tribe, extended family, estate or guild during the process

of production. Finally, the system of slavery and serfhood came to an end, leaving 
free-labor separated from the means of production and waiting to be appropriated 
through the exchange of wages for labor time.  
In understanding the economic formations which  precede capitalism as moments in 
the socio -historical process which provided the preconditions of capitalist 
production, Marx is far from inventing a mythic justification for the present system by deducing it as the final stage in a conceptual development ; on the other hand, he 
is not projecting the character of the present system back into pre -history. Rather, his 
concerns are based in the present, but he strives to show how the past was essentially 
different and then to outline the logic of the actual h istorical development which 
made capitalism possible and actual, it is a reconstruction  in the sense that it starts out 
from the end of history (so far), seeking to understand that end as the result of an historical process and to understand history as lea ding up to the present.
78 The 
resultant view of the present in terms of its formative process (as historically mediated) stands critically opposed to the (ideological) view of the given as it 
immediately appears.  
Marx’s historical analysis provides the han dle for crit ically grasping the bourgeois 
ideology of “just exchange,” the view that wages which represent accumulated labor -
time are exchanged for an equivalent amount of the worker’s living labor -time. 
Viewed from within the capitalist system, the presu ppositions of the theory of just 
exchange may well seem obviously true; but considered in terms of the historical 
prerequisites of the entire system, new presuppositions are uncovered,  and the theory 
is shown to be false. Private property is not the result  of the capitalist’s own labor, 
but is rather the result of re moving the conditions of labor (land and tools) from the 
control of the worker. In this context, the theory of just exchange is seen to be 
ideology: socially necessary illusion which obscures t he process of unjust 
appropriation.
79 
Bourgeois social theory ahistorically projects capitalist relations back to a “state of nature” in which, ironically, everyone belonged to the proletariat, i.e., embodied free -
labor deprived of property in the conditio ns of pro duction. Marx counters with a

diametrically opposed reading of history, which he documents. His argument, which 
we will now try to follow, runs roughly as follows: At the dawn of human social 
history, as nomadic life came to an end and social for mations evolved, agricultural 
production was carried out communally. Each member of the community shared in 
the ownership of the means of pro duction, the communal land and the shared tools. 
Through the historical development which eventually culminated in  capitalism, the 
relationship of the worker to the land he worked took on many forms, leading 
generally to a dissolution of the organic unity of the worker and owner. The 
conditions of production were gradually accumulated into the hands of a few (the 
capitalists), leaving the masses property -less and dependent upon others for work. 
The formation of the individual – a laborer stripped of defining ties to land and 
community, a numerical unity on the competitive job market – was an historical result 
and a pre condition of capitalism, not a natural, a -temporal phenomenon a la Robinson 
Crusoe. The same process which transformed people in social settings into abstract, 
interchangeable individuals made the products of labor into abstract, arbitrarily 
exchangeable value, commodities. The relations of capitalist production, commodity 
relations, pervaded every aspect of social existence, through their two -fold character 
obscuring the nature of social reality.  
The formation of a capitalist class, on the other hand, is likewise not the result of a 
natural, ahistorical merely quantitative inequality – that due to physiological or 
geographical differences some people have more wealth than others. Wealth can only 
count as capital in a social set ting in which some people ar e property -less, and others 
own sufficient property to provide others with materials of labor. The separation of workers from property as well as the development of industrial production skills are 
results of the historical process which precedes capital ism and their evolution is not 
to be explained in terms of capitalist relations as the theory of just exchange would 
have it. Marx is especially concerned with the transition from feudalism to capitalism 
because it is here that the capitalist first appears – taking advantage of the 
circumstances, rather than supporting the whole. The analysis is succinctly outlined 
by Marx:  
What enables monetary wealth to turn into capital is on the one 
hand, that it finds free laborers, and on the other, it finds means of 
subsistence, materials, etc., which previously were in one form or 
another the property of the now objectless masses, and are also free 
and purchasable. However, the other condition of labor – a certain 
level of skill, the ex istence of the instrument as me ans of labor, etc. 
– is already available in this preparatory or first period of capital. This 
is partly the result of the urban guild system, partly  of domestic 
industry, of such industry as exists as an accessory to agriculture. The 
historic process is not the product of capital, but its presupposition. 
By means of this process the capitalist then inserts himself as 
(historic) middleman between landed property, or property 
Marx and Heidegger  
  97 
generally, and labor. History knows nothing of the congenial 
fantasies about capita list and laborer forming an association etc.; nor 
is there a trace of them in the conceptual development of capital.80 
Contract theories of social institutions perpetuate illusions about history and the place of capitalism in history. They explain communal, social and economic relations as 
decisions of rationally calculating indiv iduals. For Marx, it is precisely rational 
calculation and the individual which must be accounted for as historical products of a process which began with naturally, spontaneously  existing human communities and 
their attendant social institutions and economic arrangements. Surveying history with an eye to the uniqueness of capitalist relations, Marx finds two major phenomena 
common to the various pre -capitalist, pre -industrial form s of society: property  in the 
conditions of one’s labor and existence as a member of a community . Having traced the 
evolution of society from the nomadic tribe through oriental despotism and classical 
city-states to the feudal Middle Ages, Marx stresses th at: 
The main point here is this: In all these forms – in which landed 
property and agriculture form the basis of the economic order, and 
where the economic aim is hence the production of use values, i.e. 
the reproduction of the individual within the specif ic relation of the 
community in which he is its basis – there is to be found: (1) 
Appropriation not through labor, but presupposed by labor; 
appropriation of the natural conditions of labor, of the earth as the 
original instrument of labor as well as its w orkshop and repository 
of raw materials. The individual relates simply to the objective 
conditions of labor as being his; . . . (2) but this relation  to land and 
soil, to the earth, as the property of the laboring individual – who 
thus appears from the out set not merely as laboring individual, in 
this abstraction, but who has an objective mode of existence  in his 
ownership of the land, an existence presupposed  by his activity and not 
merely as a result of it, a pre supposition of his activity just like his 
skin, his sense organs, which of course he also reproduces and develops, etc. in the life process, but which are nevertheless 
presuppositions of this process  of his reproduction – is instantly 
mediated by the naturally arisen, spontaneous, more or less historically developed and modified presence of the individual as 
member  of a community  – his naturally arisen presence as member of a 
tribe, etc.

This passa ge presents the basis for Marx’s analysis in his chapter, contrasting all pre -
capitalist economic form ations as a group to capitalist social relations. By viewing the 
transition from feudalism to capitalism – prepared for by all previous social history – 
as the great historical watershed, Marx stresses the uniqueness of capitalist relations, 
their socio -historical specificity, their unnaturalness.  
Many important themes of Marx’s thought are related to this passage. Property is here 
defined in terms of the means of production and private property is seen as derivative 
of communal property. The bourgeois conception of the individual in abstraction from his social setting is taken as a result of social and intellectual history; its claim to 
a priori status is rejected. People have an object ive existence in their community – as 
in their more or less historically developed language and body – which is the 
precondition of their labor, not first a result of objectification. The whole analysis reflects Marx’s radically historical approach as well as his driving  concern with 
understanding capitalism as a moment in the flow of actual history. Accordingly, both the evolution and the reproduction of society are understood as integral facets of 
social production. This h istorical approach suggests a new formulation of the theory 
of alienation, one which clearly contrasts alienation in capitalist commodity production with the organic ties of the worker in pre -capitalist economies to the 
means and materials of his work, to the product as an immediate use value and to 
himself and his community. These important themes must now be developed.  
History has teleological meaning – but only for us from our retro -perspective, not 
mystically in itself. The production of history has, according to Marx, been largely a 
byproduct of the reproduction of given situations through the production of use -
value. Given any agricultural society, the goal of production in that society was self -
perpetuation of the community through reproduction of t he race and of everyday life. 
But the natural attempt to maintain the status quo, particularly in the more advanced 
social forms, can itself force change; the fates of wars of defense have resulted in the 
rise and fall of untold numbers of nations. One of Marx’s favorite examples is the 
timely one of population expansion. It is a common observation in anthropology that certain tribal structures can perpetuate themselves indefinitely and self -sufficiently 
given a constant population and no external interfere nce. But suppose that the 
attempt to reproduce the population becomes too successful. Then the social 
relations, division of labor or form of production would be forced to change or die. 
The details of a society’s atemporal structure can thereby become cen tral to the 
dialectic of its histor ical development.  
For instance, where each individual is supposed to possess so many 
acres of land, the mere increase in population constitutes an obstacle. 
If this is to be overcome, colonization will develop and this n ecess -
itates wars of conquest. This leads to slavery, etc. Also, e.g., the enlargement of the ager publicus, and hence to the rise of the 
Patricians, who represent the community, etc. Thus,  the preservation 
Marx and Heidegger  
  99 
of the old community implies the destruction of t he conditions upon 
which it rests, and turns into its opposite.82 
The conservative impulse can remain at the base of truly revolutionary developments 
– at least within agricultural society.  
When the relations of production change in accordance with a modif ied mode of 
production, there is not merely a change in relations between unchanged people; 
people’s very natures are transformed. “The act of reproduction itself changes not 
only the objective conditions – e.g., transforming village into town, the wilderness 
into agricultural clearings, etc. – but the producers change with it, by the emergence 
of new qualities, by transforming and developing themselves in production, forming 
new powers and new con ceptions. new modes of intercourse, new needs, and new 
language.”83 
Language is an intriguing topic for Marx because of its totally historical and social 
character. Both a pre supposition and a condition of history, language is in turn 
modified by new social development. A person’s language is both a prerequisite and an expression of his membership in a community: “As regards the individual, it is 
clear, e.g., that he relates ev en to language itself as his own only as the natural member 
of a human community. Language as the product of an individual is an absurdity. But 
so also is property.”
84 The point of Marx’s references to language is that property  has 
the same characteristics  which clearly belong to language. An isolated individual could 
farm a plot of land and possess  tools – assuming he had been trained in farming and in 
the construction and use of tools – but we would not call the land and tools his property . 
Property is a social (legal, interpersonal) relationship defined by the exclusion of other 
persons from certain rights. Originally, proprietary claims took place between tribes, 
neighboring communities who claimed areas of land or natural resources as their 
property to the exclusion of other tribes. The tribal members shared the fruits of such 
property, which they owned as members of the community. They may have possessed 
homes, clothing and such individually, but the land, tools, weapons, aqueducts, seeds 
and technical knowledge were communal property. In later social systems, such as the 
Roman Empire, communal property was privately possessed – to be a Roman citizen 
and to possess Roman land were synonymous – or some combination of private and 
public lands was establish ed. 
Property refers, as the word etymologically suggests, not only to what one (legally) 
owns, but to what is (essentially) one’s own, what is “proper” to oneself. Throughout 
precapitalist history, people were defined physically and mentally, objectively a nd

Marx and Heidegger  
  100 
subjectively, economically and socially by their membership in a community. Marx 
thus concludes, “ Property therefore means belonging  to a clan (community) (having one’s 
subjective/objective existence in it); and by means of the relation of this communit y 
to the land and soil, (relating) to the earth as the individual’s body, there occurs the 
relationship of the individual to the land and soil – for the earth is at the same time 
raw material, tool and fruit – as to a presupposition belonging to his indivi duality, as 
its modes of his presence. We reduce  this property  to the relation  to the conditions  of 
production. ”85 
If people are socially defined, then society in turn can be viewed in terms of the social 
relations which are primar ily structured according  to the mode of production of the 
producing subjects. The primary relationship is that of work: productive people 
relating to nature. Work is socially mediated – people produce as members of 
communities and the structure of the communities is reciprocally conditioned by the 
mode of production. Property, too, is an expression of the work relationship, always 
defined historically in relation to the prevailing mode of production. The first half of 
Marx’s historical considerations accordingly conclude that “ property  – in its Asiatic, 
Slavonic, ancient classical and Germanic forms – therefore originally signifies a 
relation of the working (producing) or self -reproducing subject to the conditions of 
his production or reproduction as his own. Hence, according to  the condit ions of this 
production, property will take different forms.”86 
The result that Marx arrived at through analysis of capitalist relations in the Manuscripts  
– that property is historically -specifically defined, expressing the prevailing mode of 
production – is here reached through a study of pre -capitalist history. The new 
approach sheds fresh light. Not only is the illusory atemporal aura surrounding 
bourgeois private property discarded in showing the relation of private property to 
commodity  production in particular, but in drawing this relationship, the unique char -
acter of private property is revealed. Bourgeois private property differs essentially 
from all pre -capitalist forms of property, which were variations on communal 
property. “Private”  property is a privative form in that the worker no longer relates 
through the property institution to the conditions of his labor as his own. The 
opposition of labor to capital means precisely that the worker is not the owner of the 
objective basis of his  existence – and conversely the owner of the conditions and 
product of labor is not the worker who transforms the one into the other. The split of the original worker/owner unity is a fundamental expression of the alienating 
character of capitalist relatio ns. 
Dealing with alienation in terms of the worker/owner division of labor underlying 
capitalism has advantages over the view in terms of the worker’s loss of his pro duct, 
 
85 Ibid., p. 492, S. 392.  
86 Ibid., p. 495, S. 395.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  101 
although the two approaches are in the end equivalent. It may, for instance, be les s 
tempting to psychologize the worker’s frustration at self -objectification gone sour and 
keep the objective societal configuration in the fore.  
Of primary significance is the clarity with which the historical character of alienation 
appears. Alienation as  caused by a dichotomy between worker and owner is seen to 
be “unnatural,” i.e., unique to the bourgeois era and foreign to the simpler social 
forms. Accordingly, one can even recognize the relation of alienation to the destruct -
ion of the conservative val ues: sense of community, rootedness in the land, treasuring 
of tradition, pride in work manship, etc. A closer study of alienation as an historical 
development, distinguishing losses which must be recouped from those which 
represent valuable progress and p otential may suggest goals for a future society – one 
chosen more consciously and democratically than past social systems – and potentials 
for realizing them. 
How then did capitalist alienation come about? Whence the split in the previous unity 
of worker and owner? If it is not true that there have always been some people with 
property in the means of production and other, property -less people who are 
therefore dependent on the first group for jobs, then how did the capitalists come to acquire a monopoly on  property to the exclusion of the workers? The ideology would 
have it that the capitalists themselves created their property through diligent labor and 
accumulated their wealth through careful saving – in contrast to the allegedly lazy and 
wasteful masses.  Marx vigorously rejects this view and argues that the so -called 
primitive accumulation of capital was actually a rearrangement of existing property. The 
redistribution and centralization of property – of the means, materials and conditions 
of production – was made possible by developments in the mode of production: 
urban craft production in the guilds, an international money system in merchant trade, 
technical changes in spinning and weaving, etc. Property, or wealth, which became 
the capitalist’s in the t ransition from feudalism to capitalism, had already existed and 
had merely become flexible enough to be redistributed through all manner of usury, trade, hoarding, politics, trickery and force.  
Nothing can therefore be more ridiculous than to conceive the 
original  formation  of capital as if capital has stockpiled and created the 
objective conditions of production  – food, raw materials, instruments – and 
then offered them to the dispossessed  worker. What happened was 
rather that monetary wealth partly helped  to dispossess the labor 
powers of the individuals capable of work from those conditions; and in part this process of divorce proceeded without it . . .. As to the 
formation  of monetary  wealth  itself, before its trans formation into capital: 
this belongs to  the prehistory of the bourgeois economy.
87

Marx and Heidegger  
  102 
Spinning and weaving, Marx’s clearest illustration, was one of the first jobs to be 
transformed from the home into the factory. Traditionally, each family unit had its 
own spinning wheel and loom with which the f amily met its own clothing needs, as 
one of its many productive activities. After the transformation, certain individuals 
produced cloth to be sold as their sole productive activity, using the wages earned 
thereby to meet their own specific needs. Capital had neither invented nor 
manufactured the spinning wheel or loom; clothing had previously been produced and consumed. Capital neither created nor stockpiled the necessities of life which now 
had to be purchased. “The only change was,” Marx points out, “that these necessities 
were now thrown onto the exchange market  – were separated from their direct 
connection with the mouths of the retainers etc. and transformed from use value into exchange values.”
88 
The change from a worker/owner unity to the distinction  of property -less workers 
and non -productive owners meant a shift from concrete, immediate use -values to 
abstract, socially mediated exchange values. On the one hand, this shift away from 
use-values as such is a prerequisite of capitalist accumulation and deprivation: only so 
much use -value can be accumulated and still be meaningful, while no one can be 
deprived totally of use -values and continue to live. On the other hand, the shift is also 
a result of capitalism, or is reinforced by the spread of capitali st relations: someone 
who wants to buy commodities must earn money and one who earns money must meet his needs through the ex change of commodities. The totalizing character of 
capitalism is thus built into the nature of commodities, i.e., it is part of t he dynamic 
of the social relations of commodity production.
89 The so- called primitive 
accumulation of capital is to be accounted for in terms of commodity production and its demands. Commodity production, based on monetary quantity, is qualitatively 
“free.” The conditions of production become a “free fund,” liberated from their ties 
to particular individuals or families. The individuals thereby deprived of their property 
simultaneously become potentially “free wage -laborers,” obliged to sell their labor. 
For Marx, “This much is evident: the same process which divorced a mass of indiv -
iduals from their previous affirmative relations to the objective conditions  of labor, negated 
these relations and thereby transformed these individuals into free laborers , is also the 
same process which freed these objective conditions  of labor – land and soil, new material, 
necessaries of life, instruments of labor, money or all of these – potentially from their 
previous state of attachment  to the individuals now separated from  them.” Further, 
“Closer inspection will show that all these processes of dis solution mean the 
dissolution of production in which use -value predominates production for immediate 
use.” And finally, “Again, closer examination will also reveal that all
 the r esolved 
relations were possible only with a definite degree of development of the material 
 
88 Ibid., p. 507, S. 407.  
89 Cf. ibid., p. 511, S. 410f.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  103 
(and therefore also of the intellectual) productive forces.”90 The four historical 
tendencies go hand in hand: (1) from owning -worker to free -labor or wage -laborer, 
(2) from worker’s property to private property, (3) from production of use -value to 
production of exchange value or commodity production, and (4) from ag riculture to 
manufacture. Once these processes, which Marx sees as stretching in various patterns 
across the entire span of history, have completed their transformations, the scene is 
set for capitalist production, which has, indeed, already set in as part  of the historical 
process. 
The conjuncture of these four processes in Marx’s account indicate how, as already 
suggested above at the start of Chapter V, his reconstruction of the history of property 
relations, understood in their relation to the prevailin g modes of production, provides 
a unity to Marx’s doctrines, presents the core of his historical materialism and supplies 
the critical fulcrum for his critique of political economy. The thematic unity 
underlying the altering styles or ap proaches of M arx’s various writings can b e summed 
up in the term “commodity production,” a concept which is central to  all his analyses 
of capitalism, whatever vocabulary or  approach he may be using. Historical 
materialism means, for Marx, a primary concern for social medi ations, a radically 
historical methodology and an eye on the pre vailing mode of production as the 
primary determinant of an historical epoch. Arguing against non -historical theories of 
just exchange, the eternal nature of man and the pro ductivity of the capitalist, Marx 
puts political economy on a philosophically critical and politically radical basis.  
The raison d’etre of Marx’s historical approach and of his critical social theory in general 
makes a sudden appearance in the midst of his historical accou nt – in a passage 
charged with excitement and pathos. The emotions are appropriate to the paradox 
that defines capitalism’s status in history: undreamed of potential repressed. The 
freedom implied by the phrase “free labor” was not wholly sarcastic. The fe udal 
peasant is not freer than the wage -laborer even though he is not alienated and 
exploited in the same way. The peasant is chained to his plot of land and narrow occupation by the primitive mode of production as well as by corresponding 
sentiments. In c omparison, the industrial worker has a universal potential: he could 
produce in practically any manner imaginable, thanks to the developments in production resulting from capitalism – if, that is, capitalism did not at the same time 
confine him within a ph ysically and intellectually crippling division of labor and 
system of alienation. Capitalism, which made man the universal creator, reduced 
people to one -sided drudges.  
Marx rejects the short -sighted criticism of capitalism which argues that now people 
work for money or live to work where they once worked for goods, for life. What is 
money? Marx asks, What is abstract value? – when the limited bourgeois form is 
stripped away – if not “the universality of individual needs, capacities, pleasures, 
 
90 Ibid., p. 502f, S. 402.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  104 
productive f orces, etc. created through universal exchange? The full development of 
human mastery over the forces of nature, those of his own nature as well as those of 
so-called nature?”91 In bourgeois political economics – and in the epoch of 
production to which it corresponds – this complete elaboration of what lies within 
man appears as a complete emptying -out, this universal objectification as total 
alienation, and the tearing down of all limited, one- sided aims as sacrifice of the 
(human) end -in-itself to an enti rely external end. The origin of Marx’s defin ition of 
man as homo faber universalis  in the Manuscripts  – and of the anti -capitalist desires to 
achieve human creative potential today – can be traced to the economics of the era 
of capitalist production, whi ch is immanently criticized for suppressing the 
possibilities it has developed.  The introduction of abstract value and abstract (“free”) 
relations in general on a pervasive scale has abolished provincial limitations, creating “social value” which joins all  aspects of life into a worldwide social totality. At the 
same time, however, it subordinates use -value to calculations of private exchange 
value (profit), rather than raising them to the level of “ social use- values.” The alienation 
of historically produce d human nature and the repression of attempts at human 
liberation are to be understood in terms of the two -faced progress represented by 
commodity relations. Far from basing itself on theological or Victorian faith in the necessary progress of humanity, Ma rx’s analysis incorporates an insight into the self -
annihilation of progress to date. To trace this stunted dialectic of value in hopes of freeing it from the fetishism of commodities is the task of Capital .

Chapter VI. Presentation: Capital  
The dialectic of enlightenment has reached a contradictory stage in the era of 
capitalism, an economic system which creates the potential for a new humanity while 
exploiting people and which universally propagates an un dreamed of wealth of 
knowledge in the form of mass  deception.92 Capital , an analysis of the system of 
commodity production in its ideal conceptual purity, provides clarifications which lead to a comprehension and calculus of its emancipatory and repressive tendencies. 
The two- faced rationalizations of bou rgeois political economy – ideology in an 
emphatic sense – are traced by Marx to the bifurcated nature of commodities and of 
their production. Conceptual, social and historical analysis dispels the confusions 
which characterize the fetishism of commodities  and paints the way to realizing the 
un-kept promises of our epoch. The capitalists’ most authentic language, the 
equations of profit, is transformed into indices of exploitation and calculations of 
potential human progress by questioning the foundations o f capital which had 
remained presupposed but unspoken.  
The Form of Value of Commodities  
A repeated  conclusion of the preceding interpretation of Marx’s work has been that the 
realm of production has a priority in the analysis of society and that an analysi s of 
capitalism must therefore begin with a consideration of commodity production. Part I of the first volume of Capital  is accordingly on “Commodities and Money.” The 
discussion takes place in terms of a theory of commodity value, designed to clear the confusions surrounding the nature of money.  
In his original preface to Capital , where he warns of the difficulty of reading Part I, 
Marx likens his economic science to biology and chemistry, which study the 
elementary cell or molecule in order to understand large complex bodies. In Marxian 
economics, however, the “force of abstracti on” must replace the tools of microscope 
and chemical reagents, increasing the conceptual strain. Continuing the analogy, Marx 
states that in capitalist society “the commodity form of the product of labor or the

Herder & Herder, 1972); Dialektik der Aufklärung  (Amsterdam: Querido, 1947).  
Marx and Heidegger  
  106 
form of value of the commodity is the econom ic cell form.”93 Thus, the starting point 
for a systematic presentation of capitalist production is the commodity form of 
products and the form of value of the commodity.  
Several models of systematic presentation useful in following Marx’s arguments 
sugges t themselves. The extreme contemporary form of systematization is 
axiomatization, in which one begins with formal definitions and mathematized axioms, proceeds through a hierarchy of theorems derived from the axioms and finally 
provides an interpretive sch eme relating the most derived propositions to reality. 
Marx’s analysis of the way in which the quantitative value of a commodity varies under different conditions is easily adapted to this mathematical approach.
94 A parallel 
technique is the dialectical me thod Hegel employs in his Science of Logic which, for 
instance, analyses the mutual determinations of what he calls “reflex categories.” This 
approach is very much at work in Marx’s development of the form of value. However, 
as opposed to mathematics and idealism, Marx’s work is materialistic and political. Materialistically, the presentation of commodity production stresses the historical 
specificity of this mode of production and grounds the analytic categories in their 
historical object. As political, Capital strives to reveal the situation of people in society 
– a task necessitated by the tendency of commodity relations to obscure social, 
interpersonal relations. 
Capital ’s path from the simple abstraction of the commodity to the complex 
concreteness of c apitalist production as a totality is at every level teleologically 
determined by its real object, as this had been encountered in the con crete history of 
class struggles and in a succession of pre -Marxian theories of surplus value. Of 
particular interest  in relation to continental philosophy from Hegel to Heidegger, is 
the way in which Chapter 1, which culminates in the revelation of the secret of 
commodity fetishism, is motivated by the misleading character of the form in which 
the value of commodities “ appear.”

Marx’s discussion of the form of value, his most original theoretical contribution to 
the analysis of capitalist economics, is the most difficult section of Capital . The history 
of Marx interpretation can be viewed as a kaleid oscope of misinterpretations of this 
section. Marx was well aware of the problem and posted warnings repeatedly. On the 
first page of text in Capital , in his Preface to the first edition, preceded only by a note 
on the circum stances of publication, Marx warned:  
All beginnings are dif ficult; this goes for every science. The 
comprehension of the first chapter, namely the section containing the 
analysis  of commod ities, will therefore present the most difficulties. That 
which specifically concerns the analysis  of the substance  of value and of 
the magnitude  of value, I have popularized as much as possible. Not so 
with the analysis of the form of value. This is difficult to understand 
because the dialectic is much sharper than in the first presentation. I 
therefore advise the reader who is not thoroughly accustomed to 
dialectical thinking to completely skip the section from p.15 to p.34 
and instead to read the appendix at the end of the book, “The Form 
of Value.” There I have tried to present the matter as simply and 
even as didactically as its scientific nature allows. After finishing the 
Appendix, the reader can proceed with the text at p.35. The form of 
value, whose completed Gestalt is the money  form, is without content 
and simple. Never theless, the human spirit has sought in vain for 
more than 2000 years to get to the bottom of it.95 
In later editions and in the English translation, the section of sharp dialectics and the 
reference to it in the Preface have been deleted and the appendix has been moved 
into the text as the bulk of section  3. The popularized replacement and its translation

are so commonsensical that it is easy to overlook what remains of the “sharp dialectic” 
and to misjudge this cornerstone of Marx’s theory.  
Especially if one is to consider Capital  as a philosophical state ment adhering to 
rigorous methodology, it is imperative to follow the first edition’s analysis of the form 
of value. For it is here that Marx unfolds his dialectical materialist presentation of 
abstract labor, as the defining characteristic of capitalist p roduction. Once 
comprehended, this presentation preserves the revolutionary content of the labor theory of value from bourgeois revision, not least of all by revealing the secret  of 
commodity fetishism. The genetic demystifying de -construction of fetishism  disarms 
the power of commodity relations to obscure their origin in the labor of the work ing 
class. Accordingly, the following discussion of Capital  will limit itself to retracing 
Marx’s sharp dialec tic from the definition of the commodity, through the 
establishment of abstract labor, to the domination of fetishism.  
Through an understanding of the significance of this dial ectic, the separation of 
Marx’s work into an interpretive (qualitative) outlook and an explanatory 
(quantitative) calculus can be mad e more precise in terms of the analysis of the 
substance, magnitude and form of value. The view that human labor is the substance  
of all value provides  a basis for proletarian “ideology.” Economics which calculates 
the magnitude  of value on the basis of th e quantity
 of socially necessary labor time 
embodied in a product can serve as a corresponding “science.” Marx’s approach is 
not strictly opposed to these, but neither is it limited to them. Marx’s analysis of the 
form of value –  which presupposes neither its substance nor its magnitude – provides 
a basis for what would otherwise be “mere ideology,” a perspective chosen on the basis of self- interest alone. By comprehending the social constitution of abstract labor 
as an historically developed category, the analysis of the form of value provides the 
theoretical precondition for defining the substance and magnitude of value in terms 
of abstract human labor. 
An ideology of labor makes the same false move as the ideology of  capital: 
absolutizing categories of the present era as eternal. Marx’s goal is not the worship of 
labor – it was not he who coined the concentration camp slogan, “work makes one 
free” – but the just reward for the unfortunate necessity (un -freedom) of work. Just 
reward according to the theory in Capital  consists in the worker owning the surplus 
value produced by his work or, less simplistically, a society of producers jointly owning the full product of their social labor. The theory of surplus value which spells 
out this goal takes labor as the substance of value and labor time as the measure of 
the magnitude of value. But it is the analysis of the form of value as historically specific 
which lends the critical sharpness to the socialist goal as anti -capita list, as historically 
situated. 
The common impression is thus wrong, that Marx’s primary theoretical contribution 
is the proposition that commodity prices are determined by the labor time required 
for their production. Even this proposition does not, as He idegger has suggested, 
Marx and Heidegger  
  109 
claim that labor is the substance of commodities, but rather that abstract  labor is the 
substance of the value of commodities. However, even the correctly understood 
economic proposition is not peculiar to Marx. John Locke and Willia m Petty had long 
before argued for such a labor theory of value and Adam Smith and David Ricardo 
had also accepted it. Only when the capitalist class had established itself over the 
aristocracy, did economists fear that the labor theory could be transforme d from a 
bourgeois to a proletarian ideology, a possibility forcefully symbolized by the Paris Commune of 1848. Marx then championed the labor theory, but he did not present 
it with much fanfare in Capital . 
In its simple form, the proposition that labor is  the substance of value has little need 
of argumentation. Strictly speaking, this proposition is not only non -deductive, but 
for Marx it is neither descriptive nor prescriptive. It neither describes the appearance of the prevalent pricing scheme, nor simpl y provides a measure of values for a future 
society. As a theoretical abstraction, labor value grants social theory a tool for comprehending and distinguishing various aspects and categories of value. The critic 
of Marx’s theory must, therefore, answer to the power of Marx’s system to analyze 
capitalist society as well as respond to the arguments in Marx’s earlier writings and in Locke and others. It must of course be remembered that Marx never says actual prices 
are simply equivalent to a measure of labor time. Their “determination” (in the non -
mathematical sense) by labor time is merely the first of many conditioning factors – 
first not so much in quantitative importance as in the chain of increasingly complex 
explanatory analyses presented in Capital . 
Marx’s approach to the analysis of value is scarcely over simplified by starting with a 
statement from near the start of Chapter I of Capital . “We know now,” says Marx 
already, “the substance  of value. It is labor. We know its magnitude . It is labor time. Its 
form, which stamps value as exchange value, remains to be analyzed.”
96 This task of 
analyzing the form of value is indeed what remained for Marx to contribute to political 
economy. In a footnote concluding his presentation of this analysis (retained in a 
different context in later editions), Marx outlines the reasons for the previous neglect 
of this task as well as for its critical import:  
It is one of the fundamental failings of classical political economy 
that it never succeeded in discover ing, on the b asis of analysis of the 
commodity value, the form of value, which makes it into exchange 
value. Even in its best representatives, such as Smith and Ricardo, 
economics treats the form of value as something completely 
uninteresting or external to the nature of the commodity itself. The 
reason is not simply that their attention is completely absorbed by 
the analysis of the magnitude of value. It lies deeper. The form of value 
of the product  of labor is the most abstract, but also most general form of 
 
96 Ibid., S. 6. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  110 
the bourgeois mode of production, which is thereby characterized as a 
specific kind of social mode of production and is thus simultan -
eously historically characterized. If one therefore mistakes it for the 
eternal natural form of social production, then one necessa rily also 
misses what is specific in the form of value, that is, the commodity form, further developed as the money form, the capital form, and so 
on. One can thus find among economists who are in thorough 
agreement about the determination of the magnitude  of value by 
labor time the most varied and contradictory conceptions of money.
97 
Before proceeding with his analysis of the form of value, Marx clarifies the distinction 
between use value and exchange value. The use value of a commodity is its utility in 
satisfying human needs. It is a function of the physical properties of the commodity 
considered as a natural object. Although use value does depend upon the social 
development of human needs, it is a basically trans -historical category. Exchange 
value, on the other hand, is the value of a commodity in exchange, on the market. It 
is a thoroughly social category, specific to exchange economies. Commodity 
production is defined by the congruence of use value and exchange value in the 
product. Production for the  immediate satisfaction of one’s own needs is not 
considered “commodity production.” To produce commodities,  one must produce 
use values for others, social use value, products whose utility is only realized through the medium of exchange.  
This kind of defi nition, distinction and clarification could be made by any Anglo -
American philosopher and is not a primary accomplishment of Marx. However, in 
addition to stressing the social character of exchange value against the confused 
ideologues who saw the exchange  value of a commodity as a natural property, Marx 
applied the distinction to labor. This latter point, that the labor embodied in a 
commodity
 has the same two- fold character as the commodity  produced is, according 
to Marx, the fulcrum around which the comp rehension of political economy revolves. 
Marx was the first to develop this point critically. The theory of surplus value 
developed in Capital , which explains the exploitation of labor by capital, is based on 
this point. That is, the contract between capit alist and laborer, which claims to 
exchange equivalents, actually pays wages equivalent to the labor power’s exchange 
value (subsistence) in exchange for its consider ably greater use value (productivity). 
The revelation of this injustice in the exchange of wages for labor power is, indeed, 
the fulcrum for Marx’s critique of political economy.  
According to Marx’s theory of surplus value, then, the social antagonism expressed in 
the class conflict between labor and capital is based on the distinction betwee n the 
use value of labor and its exchange value. The social antagonism is thus fundamental 
 
97 Ibid., S. 34f. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  111 
to bourgeois production, in which both labor and its products are determined in 
opposing ways. For, there are not two separate kinds of labor embodied in the 
commodi ty, but rather, the labor is variously and even incompatibly “determined” 
(entgegengesetzt  bestimmt). This is the contradiction between use value and exchange 
value, which is the fundamental contradiction of capitalist society,  and which appears 
in the form of many social contradictions, antagonisms and crises. 
The potentially misleading term, “contradiction,” is to be under stood in the sense that 
production is subject to criteria which make incompatible demands. In necessarily  
compromising on each criterion under the pressure of competing criteria, the desired 
effect is altered. The contradiction develops under its own impetus in directions not 
simply related to any one of the original criteria. For instance, the drive to produ ce 
exchange value may either eliminate (as unprofitable) the production of certain 
socially urgent use values or it may encourage  over- production beyond the limits of 
consumption (as use value), resulting eventually in economic depression. Alternatively, t echno logical progress, which is encouraged by the drive for private 
profit,
 exerts a social tendency to lower the rate of profit in a self- defeating interplay 
of private and social determinants.  
Another way of looking at the capitalist contradiction is th us in terms of the 
antagonism of private and social constraints on commodity production. In pre -
capitalist, non -commodity production , the individuals (or family or tribe) themselves 
produced what was directly necessary for themselves. Production was carrie d out 
privately in accordance with private criteria or else it was carried out communally in 
accordance with purely communal require ments. In commodity production, 
production is organized privately by the capitalist who hires wage laborers to supply the l abor power and it is organized for the private end of accumulating capital. 
However, the means of achieving the end have a social character and the private 
production must fulfill social conditions. The commodity must be sold on the market 
in order for its  exchange value to be realized: it must thus be a social use value; it must 
also be competitive with other commodities on the market in terms of quality and price; this means the efficiency of the productive techniques must be up to the social 
norm; and so  on. The dynamic engendered by the definition of commodity 
production as production for private gain through social exchange can be seen in the macroeconomic development of capitalism out of feudalism and into crisis as well as 
in the microeconomic relatio ns of the steady -state system.  
The historical dynamic also reveals the material pre -conditions for the harmonious 
economic system implicit in a critique of the contradiction between use value and 
exchange value, private production and social exchange. A po st-capitalist society 
would, that is, have to remove the antagonism of exchange to human utility by 
socializing the processes of production and consumption through a non -capitalist and 
non-private distribution of both the means of production and the result s of 
production. At least some of the preconditions of such a social transformation are 
Marx and Heidegger  
  112 
already given as results of the development of capitalism: a world market, enormous 
productivity, advanced communications, computerized information processing, 
centrali zed economics and, last but not least, the threats of the consequences of 
continuing to exist under capitalist relations and crises: nuclear war, starvation in the 
third world, irreparable ecological damage, fascist governments and in general the 
repressio n of free human activity as it is now possible.  
The cornerstone of Marx’s analysis of the capitalist contradiction is the sharp dialectic 
of the form of value of the commodity form of the product of labor. The analysis of 
the form of value follows a dialectical format because it is an analysis of the mutual 
mediations of moments in the relation which defines the form of value of 
commodities. The analysis parallels Hegel’s famous master/slave dialectic in his 
Phenomenology  of Spirit because both the relation  of the form of value and the relation 
of master to slave are, like the relation of left to right, examples of what Hegel calls 
“reflex categories.” You cannot have the one without the other.  
The characteristic of commodities, versus products of pre -capita list production for 
immediate consumption, is that they are exchanged. Furthermore, they are exchanged 
in specific quantitative proportions. This emphasis on quantity is characteristic of 
capitalism, distinguishing its systematic exchange from the more spo radic, qualitative 
and variable trade and barter which plays a secondary role in pre -capitalist economics. 
The simple, first or relative form of value of the commodity is thus:  
x of commodity A = y of commodity B  
or, e.g., 20 yards of linen = one coat  
or twenty yards of linen are worth one coat.  
The form of value is the equation . The equation posits quantities of different kinds of 
commodities as equivalent. The value of the one commodity is reflected in the value  
of another and neither has a value outside of such equations or relations of exchange. 
The common denomin ator of the commodities (their substance) which allows them 
to be equated in definite proportions is labor. In equating different types of products of labor, the form of value equates the different types of labor expended. The form 
of value is thereby the source of abstract human labor as such. The next section will follow this analysis of the form of value as presented in the first edition of Capital . 
Marx and Heidegger  
  113 
Abstract Labor in Theory and Practice  
“The real relation of commodities to one another is the process  of exchange.”98 The 
relative form of value given by the equation, x of A = y of B, is the abstract  
representation of the concrete historical, social proc ess of exchange which takes place 
in terms of money; this elemental form of value is “in a certain sense the cell form or, 
as Hegel would say, the in-itself of money .”99 
In the language of the Grundrisse, the relative form of value is the ultimate abstract ion, 
from which a systematic presentation of the concrete totality can begin. Later in 
Capital , Marx deals with the real process of exchange, but in Section 1 he is working 
on a high level of abstraction comparable to that of Hegel’s Logic. Unlike Hegel, 
however, Marx conceives of the abstract determination as itself a result of the concrete 
processes which it analyses. The abstract is only a “source” of the concrete in 
theoretical presentations, not in real historical processes. Recognizing this, Marx was 
consistently able to understand Hegel’s system better than Hegel had, namely as an 
analysis of the logic of the capitalist world as opposed to a description of actual developments. Marx’s Hegel critique is as important to his analysis of abstract labor 
as his critique of Feuerbach and religion is to the analysis of fetishism. Both these 
analyses take place in terms of Marx’s materialist dialectic of the form of value.  
A fundamental point of Hegel’s master/slave dialectic, and one which Marx accepted, is that the categories of master and slave presuppose (mediate or reflect) each other, 
so that someone is only a master in so far as others relate to him as slaves, while the others only believe that they are slaves because he is a master. Furthermore, the 
process of mutual recognition is essential to ego development, to the determination 
of consciousness as human self -consciousness. Hegel rejects as abstract and a priori 
the proclamation of human self -consciousness through Descartes’ cogito sum or 
Fichte’s Ich bin Ich. People constitute their self -consciousness of themselves as people 
through a process of social mediation. Only through the relation to another as a fellow 
man can one first relate to oneself as a man. The other thereby serves as the form of 
appea rance of the species man.
100 
Marx applies this dialectic of reflexive categories to the form of value, x of A = y of B. To begin with, A and B are natural objects, use values, but not yet commodities 
because they have not yet been determined as exchange val ues. For the purposes of 
eventual exchange, A has been equated with B in a definite proportion. A is then able 
 
98 Ibid., S. 44. 
99 Ibid., S. 15. 
100 Cf. Marx’s references to these explicitly Hegelian arguments in footnotes, ibid., S, 
18, S. 23.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  114 
to relate to itself as a value as a result of its setting itself equal to B as a value (as the 
embodiment of labor, not as a use value, for A and  B are not equal as use values since 
they have different natural properties). Insofar as it relates to itself as a value, A 
distinguishes itself as a value from itself as a use value. Whereas the use value of an 
object appears in the natural char acteristics of the isolated object, its labor value 
appears only in its relation to another commodity as qualitatively equal in certain quantities. Value thus only receives a unique form distinct from use value through its 
presentation as exchange value.  
The simple st form of (labor) value is the relative  form of the value of A relative to B, 
where A is seen to embody labor because it sets itself equal to another commodity and the only basis of comparability is the common characteristic of embodying labor. 
The fact t hat A reflects its value in the value of B, that A is mediated by B, has, in 
turn, an effect upon B. B is no longer simply a use value, but is determined as an exchangeable use value. B now possesses the form of immediate exchangeability with 
other commodi ties, the form of being an equivalent. This new determination of B as 
equivalent is a result of the same equation, x of A = y of B, which gave A the relative form of value. B’s equivalent  form of value does not merely determine B to be a value 
(an embodime nt of labor), but a value which in its physical Gestalt of being a use value 
acts as a labor value for other commodities and is thus immediately present as an 
exchange value. In this description of the equivalent form of value, the word 
“immediate” indicat es that there is no third term, such as money, mediating the 
exchangeability of B for A. The case where A is sold for money and that money is used to buy B (the formula used later in Capital : C-M-C) is the more advanced case of 
the money form of value and is excluded from the simple relative or immediate 
equivalent form of value.  
Considered purely as value, a commodity consists solely of labor, it is a crystallization 
or objectification of human labor. However, insofar as the natural form of a 
commodity rev eals the labor which went into producing it – and not all commodities 
show such physical traces – what it presents is signs of specific, concrete labors ( e.g., 
weaving ) and not of abstract human labor as such. To determine a commodity as a 
value, as the em bodiment of abstract labor, requires a process of abstraction. “To take 
linen as a physical expression of human labor, one must ignore all that really makes it 
a thing.” To consider this process of abstraction a subjective act of a judging subject 
would be  idealism: “Objectivity of human labor, which is itself abstract and lacking 
quality or content, is necessarily abstract objectivity, a product  of thought . The woven 
cotton thereby becomes a figment of the imagina tion.” Marx transfers the Hegelian 
dictum, that essence must appear, into the material realms: the determinations of 
commodities must be expressed in their material relations. “For commodities  are material  
Marx and Heidegger  
  115 
objects (Sachen). What they are, they must show in their own material ( sachlichen ) 
relations .”101 
Such materialism ( Sachlichkeit) is neither a “metaphysical” assumption nor an 
immediate consequence of Marx’s situation in a context of rising capitalism. Its 
distance from both is due to the mediation of critical reflection. It represents a critique 
of Hegelian idealism and utopian thought, on the one hand, and that vulgar 
materialism which takes money as the really real, on the other. Marx’s materialism 
includes the thesis that the concept, the ideal and the dollar are all abstractions, to be 
compreh ended and demystified in terms, ultimately, of commonsensical natural 
objects. Marx thus rejects Hegel’s claim that the concept ( Begriff) can objectify itself 
without needing an external matter. But Marx’s approach here goes significantly 
further, even lay ing the basis for a possible critique of Heidegger. 
As any hermeneute knows, the interpretation of something as something must be 
founded in the matter itself ( Sache  selbst). Where Heidegger speaks in the anonymous 
passive voice of the way in which beings “are given as present,” Marx not only 
describes the way commodities actively present themselves, but goes on to show how 
the apparent activity of commodities is a mask for the underlying action of their 
producers, human beings. This should become clear in the analysis of fetishism. For 
now, the comparison with Heidegger can clearly be seen in Marx’s summarizing 
statement: “The natural form of the commodity changes into the form of value. 
However,  this quid pro quo brings itself about ( ereignet  sich) . . . only within the 
relationship of value .”102 Here Marx uses the term, sich ereignen, which Heidegger has 
more recently chosen as the term most appropriate to articulating ontological 
transformations. But where Heidegger uses das Ereignis as a “place holder” for transformative 
processes without committing himself to any content, Marx uses it to express a process of interaction between commodities, thus a social process involving the exchange market. The task of Marx’s sharp 
dialectic in Section 1 of Capital is, in fact, to trace this process of ontological transformation from 
beings as natural use values to beings as social labor values and to comprehend the change in Being as a fundamentally social process. 
The use value of an object depends directly u pon its natural properties. These natural 
properties express its use value. The use value of a commodity is non -relative, non -
abstract and non -quantitative. Labor value is otherwise. It is a measure of abstract 
human labor, which is not simply identical to  the specific concrete labor that went 
into producing the commodity. In the relation, x of A = y of B, A is contrasted to B 
as a different kind of use value. Only thereby can the concrete labor embodied in B 
express the abstract  labor which constitutes the  value of A. This is because the non -
equivalence of the use values of A and B implies the non -equivalence of the concrete 
 
101 Ibid., S. 17. 
102 Capital , p. 56, S. 37.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  116 
labors in A and B, leaving as a basis of equivalence only the fact that A and B were 
produced by human labor. B (a use value) becomes the form of appearance of A’s 
labor value because A relates to B as an immediate embodiment of abstract human 
labor. The labor that went into producing B is not taken as specific, goal -oriented 
productive activity, but only as a form of objectification or realization of human labor 
in general.  
The natural form of A can express A’s use value, but cannot express its labor value. 
However, by A relating to B as an equivalent in the form, x of A = y of B, the natural 
form of B is made to express the labor value of A. In this relation, the concrete labor 
of B becomes an expression of abstract human labor. Thereby, abstract labor and 
labor value receive material  expression in terms of concrete labor and use value. In 
contrast to the determination of use value and c oncrete labor, the determination of 
labor value and abstract labor can only take place within the relations of commodity 
to commodity, and that means within a social context in which commodities are 
exchanged. The theoretical concepts most central to Marx’ s critique of capitalist 
production are thus results of capitalist praxis  and are shown to be such by Marx’s 
theoretical practice.  
The simplest forms of value of commodities, the simple relative and the simple 
equivalent forms, were given in the single equ ation which expresses the form of 
simple exchange, x of A = y of B. Economic science in the narrow sense is concerned 
with the quantitative relations of exchange value, costs, the ratio of x to y, price. This 
concern, however, presupposes that B has been d etermined as an equiv alent which 
can be compared to A quantitatively in terms of a common denominator and (insofar 
as socially necess ary labor time is taken to be at least one determinant of exchange 
value) economics presupposes that the concrete labor e mbodied in A and B can be 
determined as abstract human labor. 
As a reflection upon these two presuppositions, Marx’s an alysis of the form of value 
provides a theoretical basis for the substance of value (abstract labor) and the magnitude  
of value (labor time). But economics is concerned with the whole market of 
commodities and not with the case of the simple exchange of two commodities alone. 
Further, the market operates primarily in terms of monetary exchanges (not to 
mention such complications as stocks,  etc.) rather than immediate exchange of 
commodities. The simple form of value must accordingly be expanded to account for the universal  equivalence of all commodities with each other, the universal 
determination of all concrete labor as abstract human lab or and the role of money in 
commodity exchange.  
When commodity A enters the market, it sets itself in exchange relations with all other 
commodities. In addition to x of A = y of B, the following equations are also necessary 
to express the expanded  form of value: x of A = u of C, x of A = v of D, x of A = w of 
E, and so on for all other types of commodities. Here the seemingly accidental relation of the two commodities A and B is re placed by a system of relations of value. It 
Marx and Heidegger  
  117 
becomes clear in this form that  the relations of exchange are determined by the 
relative magnitude of value, rather than value being determined by exchange. That is, 
the realm of production has a priority over circulation in that value is first of all a 
function of productive labor time  and not primarily of supply and demand. 
Furthermore, this system of commodity relations provides a complete material expression for the abstraction of human labor.  
In the simple form of value , the concrete labor in A is explicitly set equivalent to the 
concrete labor in B and only implicitly thereby determined as human labor. Any other 
common factor would be purely coincidental since it is implicitly assumed that 
examples of commodities could be substituted for A or B which would not have the 
coincidental , inessential commonality. This implicit assumption is made explicit with 
the expanded form of value, in which A is related to every possible commodity and 
thus the labor in A is expressed as every possible kind of productive human labor and is thereby exp licitly materially determined as abstract  labor. 
A further step in the development of the form of value is taken by reversing the 
equations of the expanded form. Clearly, if A can be exchanged for any other 
commodity than it is also true that any other com modity can be exchanged for A. The 
expanded equivalent or universal  equivalent  form of value, which states this, can be 
represented as: y of B = x of A, u of C = x of A, v of D = x of A, w of E = x of A, 
etc. Here all commodities express their value in the  commodity A. Through A as a 
social expression of value, all commodities differentiate themselves as use values (expressed by their own natural form but not by A’s natural form) from themselves 
as exchange values (exchangeable with A). Transitively, as all  exchangeable with A, all 
commodities relate to each other as magnitudes of value, as qualitatively equal and 
quantitatively comparable. Here for the first time all commodities appear to each other 
as values, “Their value is hereby given its appropriate form of appearance as exchange 
value.”
103 That all commodities are (labor) values appears in the fact that they are all 
exchangeable with A. Their embodied abstract labor is expressed by the concrete 
labor embodied in A and their (labor) value is measured in terms of the quantities of 
A with whic h they are exchangeable.  
Through a dialectical materialist analysis of the form of value of commodities, Marx 
has argued that the essence of the value of commodities is labor value and that its 
appearance is exchange value. This form of appearance is at on ce an expression of the 
essence and its obfuscation. The half -truth character of exchange value, its socially 
necessary falsehood, provides the basis for bourgeois ideology, with its doctrine of 
just exchange, its emphasis on the realm of circulation, its rejection of labor as the 
source of surplus value, its confusion of the private and the social and its distorted 
view of the nature of money. Marx’s analysis of abstract labor is a striking example of 
the dialectical and materialist character of his method ology, for he analyses the

Marx and Heidegger  
  118 
“universal,” human labor, as a relation between material entities (the commodities B, 
C, D, . . .) and, shows how it is materially expressed (in the universal equivalent, 
commodity A, which mediates all commodity exchanges by po siting itself and all 
other commodities as objectifications of abstract labor). Rather than rejecting the 
power and dynamic of the abstract as e.g., non -empirical, Marx comprehends the life 
of the abstraction by focusing on its material expression. This ta sk automatically 
subjects the ideal which is glorified by ideology to a critique in terms of its actual social 
manifestation. The analysis of the form of value also clarifies the role of money in the 
economy by showing its derivation from the simple form o f value.  
Money is the result of further transformations of the form of value beyond the form 
of the universal equivalent. In Capital , Marx uses linen as an illustration for commodity 
A, the universal equivalent. One could just as well use any other commodi ty as the 
material expression of labor values: corn, wampum, gold, silver, etc. Money is merely 
a symbolic  representation of the material universal equival ent. In the form of paper 
money or bank balances, money is a “pure” expression of value in the sense  that it 
expresses no use value. Its “purity,” however, helps obscure its social roots, its 
derivation from the simple form of value and its relation to concrete labor, to the organization of social production, to the producers. Money specifies a particul ar social 
form of exchange, even as it hides its socio -historical specificity.  
Whether the universal equivalent is linen or money, it serves all other commodities as a universal corpus of value, a universal materialization of abstract human labor, a 
univer sal form of realization of universal labor. Inso far as all commodities reflect 
themselves as quantities of value in one and the same equivalent, they all reflect each 
other as quantities of value. The universal equiv alent mediates the relations of 
exchangeability between all other commodities, so that in a monetary economy linen is not immediately exchangeable with coat s the way each is with money: if  they are 
exchanged, the one is sold for money and the other is bought with money.  
The determination of a universal equivalent with which all commodities are immediately exchangeable is a social determination, as it must be valid throughout the 
commodity market: “In the form of exchange values, commodities appear to each other 
and relate to each other as values. Thereby, they also relate themselves to abstract 
human labor as their common  social substance . Their social relation consists exclusively in 
being for each other nothing but quantitatively different, qualitatively equal, 
interchan geable and exchangeable expressions of this, their social substance.”
104 The 
form of exchangeability of commodities, their form of value, is their social form, 
because it is their value, their exchangeability, which sets them all in social rapport.  
To analyze capitalist society, in which value is expressed as money, it is thus necessary to analyze the money form as a form of value and to show that the money form is 
 
104 Ibid., S. 28. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  119 
socially specific by distinguishing it from natural forms (e.g. , the use value of gold) 
and from forms of value in other social formations. This is the task of Marx’s critique 
of the fetishism of commodities.  
Fetishism as Appearance and Reality  
The form of value given by the equations of exchange between commodities is a form specific to an economy  where social production is carried out by private labor. 
Commod ities are products of mutually autonomous private labors, which, however, 
are interdependent in terms of a developed social division of labor. This 
interdependence is a function of the materi al differences between the products as use 
values. The products are not social values in the immediate sense of products of 
cooperative work, but are only determined as values through their relations to each 
other or, derivatively, to a universal equivalen t. The commodity form of value is a 
mediated form of social value, to be contrasted both with non -social pre -capitalist 
production and post- capitalist social production through cooperative association. The 
social form of commodities consists in their relat ions to each other, relations of 
identical human labor, relations of non -identical concrete labors in their abstractions 
as abstract labor. This relation of the products of labor to each other as products of 
abstract human labor defines the social form of labor specific to bourgeois 
(commodity) production.  
One might object that all instances of labor by people in all societies have been 
instances of the general category (universal or abstraction), human labor. But Marx 
materialistically insists that the sta ndard of “sociality” whereby the form of labor is 
categorized must “be drawn out of the nature of the characteristic relations of each mode of production and not out of conceptions external to them.”
105 The labor 
involved in producing a commodity is not imm ediately determined, as human labor, 
but rather as concrete labor of weaving, tailoring, etc. Only mediately , through the 
relations of exchange, is such labor determined as abstract labor by being set equal to 
the labor embodied in the universal equivalen t. Wage labor, for instance, is abstract 
labor worth so much per hour when its concrete labor power is posited as relative to gold or wages. Labor, the activity of people in society, is interrelated in capitalist 
society through a highly developed network of productive specializations. However, 
this nexus of social relationships has a mediated form: it only comes to express ion 
through the relations of exchange of the products of labor, the commodities. In 
particular, people’s social relations are expressed  by the universal equivalent 
 
105 Ibid., S. 32. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  120 
commodity or, as relations of wage labor to capital, inter personal relations of 
productions are expressed in monetary terms.  
The universal equivalent exhibits a tendency to conceal its origin in commodity 
relations, let alone in the social relations of the people who produce the commodities. 
This tendency towards a false appearance ( falsche Schein) begins with the simple 
equivalent, B in the equation x of A = y of B. In the simple form of value, A takes 
the active role, set ting itself equal to B. The character of equivalence that B has in the 
simple relation only as a result of this reflexive relation seems to belong to B 
“naturally.” It seems that A relates to B because  B is a materialization of abstract human 
labor, something  already present as a corpus of value. The illusion is, however, not 
yet complete in the simple form, because along with the tendency to attribute B’s immediate exchangeability to B as a physical characteristic independent of its relation 
to A is the opposing tendency to treat A and B as interchangeable by reversing the equation.  
With the development of the form of value from the simple equivalent to the universal 
equivalent, the tendency for the underlying relations to be obscured is strengthened. 
The universal equivalent seems merely to be a “natural” expression of value because 
the opposed moments of this form of value no longer develop identically for the 
commodities which are related. The form is now an asymmetric many -to-one relation 
of all possible types of commodities to the single equivalent. This form distinguishes 
the universal equivalent as something entirely set apart from all other commodities. 
Further, the character of the universal equivalent is in fact no longer dependent upon 
its relation to any one other commodity and it therefore seems to be prior to and 
independent of each of the relations which determine it. The tendency of the universal 
equivalent to obscure its origin in the form of value and its nature as an expression of 
exchange re lations and of the social relations which underlie exchange resulted in the 
myriad confused theories of money which Marx confronted.  
The system of commodity production, in which money plays a well -defined role, is 
one possible means for relating the variou s specialized labors which take place in a 
technological society. People here relate their various labors to each other as abstract 
human labor by means  of relating their products to each other as values. The social, 
inter- personal relation is concealed by  the physical form of the commodities. In 
commodities, the substance of value (human labor) is no longer visible. In order to 
relate their products as commodities, people are forced to equate their labors with 
abstract human labor. The relations of commodi ties, expressed in money as the 
universal equivalent of all commodities, force this upon people regardless of what 
theories people may have concocted to explain the form of their activity. In a society 
of commodity production, the economic relations, which  are after all results of human 
interaction, take over a priority and autonomy from people’s conscious intentions. In such a situation, economics forms a “base” underlying the “superstructure” of all 
attempts to comprehend and control economic forces.  
Marx and Heidegger  
  121 
Marx ’s theory of capitalist society uncovers the determination of the magnitude of 
value by labor time as the secret hiding beneath the apparent development of the 
relative value of the commodity. It does this by showing how the form in which value 
appears in capitalist production forces people to equate their labors to abstract labor 
by equating all the products of labor to a universal equivalent which expresses the objectification of abstract labor. It is precisely this form of value which conceals the 
social  relations of the private laborers and the social specificities of the private labors 
in objects rather than revealing them. The form of value which the product of labor takes in the historically specific  bourgeois mode of production, the exchange value of  
commodities, results in a fetishism of the products as things independent of social 
relations. 
The mode of production analyzed in Capital  is one in which private producers 
establish social contact with one another through their private products, through 
material objects. The determinations of social criteria for production, consumption 
and distribution are mediated by commodity relations. Consequently, rather than the social relations of products being and appearing as social relations of people at work, 
they appear as material relations of people or social relations of material objects.
106 
The social relations of people make their appearance in the realm of material objects 
in a form which seems independent of the interpersonal realm. In analogy with 
religi on, in which, according to Feuerbachian critique, social relations of people are 
worshipped as sacred entities in a heavenly realm prior to human society, Marx calls this apparent transference “fetishism.”  
Marx goes beyond Feuerbach’s critique of religion by situating contemporary religious 
forms within the superstructure of commodity production. He argues that, “for a 
society of commodity producers, whose general social relations of production consist 
in relating to their pro ducts as commodities, thus as  values, and in relating their private 
labors to each other in this material  form as identical  human labor, Christianity , with its 
cult of abstract man – namely in its bourgeois development, Protestantism, deism, 
etc. – is the corresponding form of religion.” Against Feuerbach, Marx insists that an 
intellectual criticism of religion, especially an argument which itself adop ts a cult of 
abstract man and which fails to situate religion in a social context, cannot be effect ive. 
As early as in his fourth “Thesis on Feuerbach” Marx had pointed out that a prerequisite to defeating religion was the removal of its original social m otivation. 
In Capital , Marx has precisely located the origin of religious fetishism along with 
fetishism of commodities in the cult of abstract man and abstract labor, which mediate social relations under capitalism. Religion cannot be abolished without el iminating 
commodity fetishism. The latter can only disappear once the form of value is trans -
formed into a social structure which does not obscure the social, interpersonal 
relations of production. This is tantamount to a call for the overthrow of wage -labor 
 
106 Ibid., S. 40. 
Marx and Heidegger  
  122 
and commodity production. It should, incidentally, be clear that Marx’s position is 
forcefully opposed to any cult of abstract man, including the “humanism” Heidegger 
tries to saddle him with. Capital , Marx’s mature theory, which was at least implicit i n 
his earlier Manuscripts , does not object to alienation on the basis of some idealistic 
conception of the nature of man. It reveals the process whereby the social 
relationships, which in every society determine the form of human potential, are 
alienated from  people through the fetishism of  commodities. The economic basis for 
this development is given by the form of value of commodities as exchange value. This form of value is due to the relation of the worker as wage laborer to the capitalist 
as owner of t he produced commodities.  
Although abstract human labor is the substance or essence of value in bourgeois society, 
the form of value taken by this essence, the form in which it manifests itself in 
appearance, is exchange value. This appearance is not an arb itrary lie, but a socially 
necessitated illusion. As part of his analysis of the essence of (labor) value, Marx was 
thus obliged to analyze the form of material expression of this value in the exchange 
value of inter -related commodities. This analysis of t he form of material expression 
of value, was, in fact, Marx’s major contrib ution to the theory of labor value, 
combining classical political economy’s concern with the appearance of exchange 
value and proletarian ideology’s insistence on the essence of hu man labor value. 
Such a unity of theory and practice within the concerns of social theory is necessary 
if social theory is to contribute
 effectively to the transformation of capitalist society. 
Social reform is objectively impossible under advanced capital ist society. The 
contradictions of capitalism do not make reformation easier, rather, they infect any 
attempts at change, distorting and strangling them. Surely any action against the social 
system which unknowingly adopts that very system’s ideologies ( e.g., a naively 
moralistic demand for equality based on the cult of abstract man) without subjecting 
them to social critique is doomed from the start to fail in its simplistic object ives. The 
failure of reforms is today attributed to “cooptation” and not to  a lack of theory, 
however.  
Cooptation can, nevertheless, be comprehended within Marx’s theory of capitalist 
society. A reform is undertaken on the basis of its inherent or essential qualities as 
perceived abstractly. When the reform is put into practice, however, it is mediated by 
its social context, by all the other existing criteria which also condition its object. The aided reformist criteria interact with the pre -existing social criteria to develop 
qualitatively new and unexpected effects. Thereby, som ething which may “work in 
theory” may not have the anticipated results in practice. This is particularly true in the 
context of bourgeois social relations, where essential determinants are obscured and 
distorted. The appearance created by the effects upon reforms due to pervasive 
commodity relations and the consequent obfuscation of commodity fetishism tend to result in cooptation. The attempted reform is transformed under the commodity form 
of relations. The relation of the conscious reformers to their int ended reform is 
Marx and Heidegger  
  123 
obscured and takes on the apparent form of a relation of “the owners of capital” to a 
reform which has been altered to serve their interests. The apparent benefactors of 
the distorted reform need not be identifiable, they need not exist as individual people. 
The reform has simply been made to serve the criteria of exchange value or capital 
and the human agents presumed to be behind this fetish are invisible, autonomous, 
abstract, indefinable: the System, the Man, the They, the Power Elite. 
Abstract moralism and purely practical power politics fail equally to challenge the 
status quo if they do not reflect upon the ways in which reforms are mediated by their 
form of material expression in the given social context. Because the various 
determina tions interact in opposing ways and develop beyond their original forms, 
the materialistic analysis of the form of appearance or the essence must be dialectical. 
It must, furthermore, be informed by an historical sense, both of the continuous social 
dynamic and of differing historical forms as various possible forms of appearance of a particular essence. 
Idealism and empiricism, theory without concern for practical expression and the 
acceptance of appearance without comparison to essence are both ideologica l, un-
critical. They are instances of the one -dimensional thought which corresponds to 
bourgeois society without being able to transcend it.
107 Marx’s presentation of an 
analysis of capitalist society in Capital , on the contrary, unifies the theoretical and  the 
practical within theory, thereby penetrating for any political practice which it informs 
the illusions generated by the fetishism of commodities.
