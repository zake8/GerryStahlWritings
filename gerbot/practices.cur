The text is an article published in the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. The article, written by Gerry Stahl, discusses the importance of analyzing group practices in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Stahl argues that traditional pre/post comparisons in CSCL research miss sequential interactional processes and reduce group phenomena to individual or social factors. Instead, he proposes that the analysis of the enactment of practices by small groups in CSCL contexts can systematically inform the design, testing, and refinement of collaborative-learning software, curriculum, pedagogy, and theory. The article also touches on the methodological tension in CSCL research, which has been described as an opposition of quantitative versus qualitative approaches. Stahl proposes a new method for CSCL that focuses on the small-group unit of analysis, where one would expect to observe collaborative learning in CSCL.

The text also includes four case studies that analyze group practices in CSCL. The case studies demonstrate the importance of group practices in communicating, problem-solving, collaborating, and using software. The analysis of the adoption and reuse of group practices in interaction data can pinpoint how concrete groups learn and achieve (or fail to achieve) group-cognitive accomplishments. The scaffolding of suggested group practices through teacher presentations before group sessions, help videos during sessions, and classroom reflectons after sessions can guide and enrich the collaborative-learning experience.

In summary, the text argues for the importance of analyzing group practices in CSCL and provides case studies that demonstrate the value of this approach. The author suggests that a focus on group practices can inform the design of technologies, curriculum, and pedagogy to support the adoption of key group skills in CSCL.
