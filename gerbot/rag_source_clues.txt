Gerry Stahl's Assembled Texts:
My CV lists about 400 publications and presentations.
To organize them thematially and to make them more accessible, I have assembled the best versions of them in 21 volumes. To the extent possible, I have made these volumes available for free in electronic format (pdf, epub and mobi) and at low cost in paperback.
Most of these texts are related to issues of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), the effort to take advantage of networked digital technology to create new opportunities for students to create shared knowledge and to learn together. The most important articles on my CSCL research in the Virtual Math Teams project are presented systematically in my five academic publications (reproduced as volumes 3-6 and 19).
A guide to the eLibrary as well as an overview of my work and life is compiled in volume 18: Overview and Autobiographical Essays. 
Note that volumes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 19 were commercially published. My PDFs are not the official versions, but are pre-publication versions for informal use.
Why did I collect my writings in these volumes? As the official list of my publications approached and then exceeded two hundred distinct textual artifacts, it became difficult for me to keep track of their interrelationships. Many texts built upon previous ones in complicated ways, perhaps merging ideas from multiple sources, extending the analysis in different directions, situating common thoughts in contrasting contexts, providing updated versions or simply referencing each other.
In looking back over the titles and thinking about their contents, I realized that what I have really wanted to say with all this has still not come to word satisfactorily, perhaps because it cannot be adequately presented in the confines of a journal article or conference presentation. It seemed to me that many of my papers more or less circled a concept, which I gradually began to refer to as "group cognition." I compiled my most important writings from the decade of 1995-2005 in my first major book, "Group Cognition." When I got to read this compilation in one coherent text, I felt that the volume succeeded in saying considerably more than the sum of its individual contributions.
Fearing that the sheer number of my publications--substantially increasing every year--must cause problems for my readers, assuming that they want to grasp what I am trying to say, I therefore determined to continue to assemble fragments of my published output into meaningful and synthetic collections. The second such attempt was with "Studying Virtual Math Teams," which gathered together the most important writings as of 2009 about the research project that I directed from 2003-2012, including chapters by colleagues and international collaborators.
During the summer of 2010, I decided to explore self-publication, which brings with it many benefits for the author, the readers and the texts. For the author, it offers complete control and reduces the turn-around time from years to hours. For readers, it reduces the costs to nothing or to low print-on-demand fees, and offers multiple e-book formats. For the texts, it makes them available in multiple formats and allows them to be updated easily.
I have now published my collected writings, starting with my dissertations and then some early essays in philosophy. I tried to collect the best versions of all my academic writings that I consider worth republishing, and gathered them in volumes based on theme and chronology. They are all conveniently accessible from this site. I hope this allows readers to make better sense of the words that I have put on paper and/or on the computer screen.
I began writing as a student of philosophy. In that field, books are the traditional medium of choice. All the great philosophers have their ideas arrayed in their collected works volumes in the library stacks. In the 21st century, books seem old-fashioned; brief blogs, YouTube sound bites and even tiny tweets are preferred. But the complex issues involved in something like CSCL may require book-length treatments (or even multiple volumes). Otherwise, the educational reforms enunciated by Dewey, the collaborative learning suggested by Vygotsky and the computer support of collaboration prototyped by Engelbart would have been implemented in schools long ago.
I hope that this eLibrary allows readers to browse through my writings and follow their interests as deeply as they desire through these aggregated texts.

      "summary": "The text is an article published in the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. The article, written by Gerry Stahl, discusses the importance of analyzing group practices in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Stahl argues that traditional pre/post comparisons in CSCL research miss sequential interactional processes and reduce group phenomena to individual or social factors. Instead, he proposes that the analysis of the enactment of practices by small groups in CSCL contexts can systematically inform the design, testing, and refinement of collaborative-learning software, curriculum, pedagogy, and theory. The article also touches on the methodological tension in CSCL research, which has been described as an opposition of quantitative versus qualitative approaches. Stahl proposes a new method for CSCL that focuses on the small-group unit of analysis, where one would expect to observe collaborative learning in CSCL.

The text also includes four case studies that analyze group practices in CSCL. The case studies demonstrate the importance of group practices in communicating, problem-solving, collaborating, and using software. The analysis of the adoption and reuse of group practices in interaction data can pinpoint how concrete groups learn and achieve (or fail to achieve) group-cognitive accomplishments. The scaffolding of suggested group practices through teacher presentations before group sessions, help videos during sessions, and classroom reflectons after sessions can guide and enrich the collaborative-learning experience.

In summary, the text argues for the importance of analyzing group practices in CSCL and provides case studies that demonstrate the value of this approach. The author suggests that a focus on group practices can inform the design of technologies, curriculum, and pedagogy to support the adoption of key group skills in CSCL.",

Gerry Stahl's book explores the philosophies of Karl Marx and Martin Heidegger, arguing for their relevance in interpreting and transforming the world. Stahl contends that both Marx and Heidegger are essential for understanding the world, as interpretation precedes transformation. The text discusses the similarities between the philosophies of Marx and Heidegger, and the potential for a combined approach to interpret the development of society and uncover potentials for the future. Key terms include hermeneutics, commodity fetishism, technological Being, essence and appearance, ideology critique, and destructive hermeneutics. The text is aimed at a philosophical audience interested in critical theory, hermeneutics, and social theory.

The text also analyzes Heidegger's comments on Marx in his essay "Letter on Humanism" and argues that Heidegger fails to recognize the unity and originality of Marx's thought. The text emphasizes the importance of the theoretical approach and the claim that the true structure of reality has been obscured in both Marx and Heidegger's work. The text is an analysis of Marx's critique of political economy, focusing on his methodology and conceptualizations, and highlights Marx's concept of "free labor" as a historical precondition for wage labor and capital.

The text also discusses Marx's concept of alienated labor in a capitalist society and its consequences, with private property being both a result and a necessary consequence of externalized labor. The ultimate goal of Marx's analysis is to reveal the true nature of capitalist society and to provide a framework for understanding and transforming it.

Heidegger's concept of "thinging" is introduced, where things gather the Four (earth, heaven, holy, mortal) to allow a world to come into being. The text also discusses Heidegger's concept of technology as "Gestell," and the problematic of the history of Being. It touches on the Marxist critique of Heidegger's concept of technology and compares various works of philosophy and critical theory from German philosophers and critical theorists.

The book includes essays on computer-supported collaborative learning, group cognition, and online mathematics interaction. Another text discusses a computer-support theory for design interpretation, proposing a system called HERMES that facilitates reuse and plasticity of representations during interpretation. A human-centered approach to computer support in planning and design is emphasized, allowing for individual views, judgments, and perspectives.

In design, tacit and explicit understanding play crucial roles, with designers relying on tacit knowledge and skills for interpretation. Heidegger's philosophy highlights the importance of tacit preunderstanding in all understanding, which can be explicated into explicit understanding. Hermeneutics, rooted in Greek mythology, is a philosophy of interpretation fundamental to human existence, and Heidegger's ideas are central to situated cognition.

Two case studies focus on the design process of a lunar habitat, addressing privacy, light, dirt, and noise concerns. NASA's guidelines for manned-systems design consider privacy, but struggle to formulate important design concerns as generic domain knowledge. The authors suggest potential for capturing design ideas as they emerge during engaged design activities.

Key themes and concepts include understanding, interpretation, preunderstanding, hermeneutics, tacit and explicit knowledge, computer support, and design.

      "summary": "This summary pertains to a series of chapters from various sources, all connected to the use of computers in supporting design interpretation. The chapters discuss the limitations of computers in comprehending and interpreting design, as they lack intentionality and tacit understanding. The fundamental problem lies in the lack of access to "semantic resources," making it difficult for computers to understand the meaning behind symbols. A theory of computer support for interpretation in design must address this issue and consider the social grounding of interpretation.

Design is viewed as an interpretive process, and interpretation is described as situated, perspectival, and linguistic. The role of tacit and explicit understanding in computer support of design is also discussed. The transformation of tacit to explicit forms of knowledge is considered essential for a theory of computer support of interpretation in design.

The chapters also explore the complex, open-ended, and collaborative nature of design, particularly in the context of lunar habitats. The need for computational tools to support design processes, balancing tacit and explicit understanding, is emphasized. The PHIDIAS and MIKROPLIS systems, which incorporate a query language for issue-bases, are discussed as examples of systems that implement these principles.

The HERMES system, a hypermedia-based design environment for representing and interpreting design rationale, is presented as a solution for exploratory domains like lunar habitat design. The system uses a hypermedia substrate to define various media for content of nodes and includes a language for navigating links and retrieving information. The perspective mechanism of HERMES allows links between nodes to maintain lists of which perspectives can view the connected nodes.",

The language has four levels: Beginner, Advanced, Programmer, and Designer, with increasing capabilities. HERMES uses perspectives to organize information in overlapping categories, such as hierarchies of personal and group viewpoints, technical aspects, and domain traditions. Perspectives can be implemented using methods like lazy virtual copying, and can be merged and evolved. The language is non-imperative and primarily geared towards information retrieval needs. It is used to define interpretive critics, which can analyze the state of the hypermedia database and provide messages or take actions based on the results. The overall purpose of HERMES is to support a model of human interpretation as situated, perspectival, and linguistic, and to contribute to human emancipation by extending cognitive capabilities through people-centered software.",

In a separate summary, the discovery of four coins on the Nickerson homestead in Cape Cod offers insights into the property's economic history and colonial commerce. The coins, dating from 1644 to 1682, include a Massachusetts silver sixpence, an English half-groat, an Irish copper halfpenny, and an English Charles II bronze farthing. The sixpence, minted in Boston, is notable as the only silver coinage struck in the American colonies before Independence. The coins' presence suggests limited access to British Isles coinage in seventeenth-century Cape Cod, with no evidence yet of Spanish New World coins.",

The text highlights the importance of socio-cultural aspects in learning and the role of technology in supporting collaboration. CSCL, a key concept, involves groups building knowledge through shared discourse, often facilitated by technology.

The text discusses two major sources of CSCL theory: Vygotsky and Lave & Wenger, who proposed that cognition is mediated by artifacts and social practices. A prototypical CSCL example shows how three 13-year-old girls achieved impressive geometry accomplishments and increased individual skills using Virtual Math Teams. The text suggests CSCL skills may be critical for addressing societal problems.

The text also emphasizes the temporal nature of the learning process, critiquing the dominant quantitative method in learning research. It proposes a process-analysis approach focusing on temporality and sequentiality, suggesting temporal-event analysis as a methodological link between descriptive, interpretive accounts of group interactions and experimental, quantitative research.

The text highlights the importance of intersubjectivity, or shared understanding, in effective collaboration and introduces the concept of learning-to-learn-together. It also explores the role of artifacts and technological infrastructures in mediating human cognition and group cognition, introducing the theory of instrumental genesis.
