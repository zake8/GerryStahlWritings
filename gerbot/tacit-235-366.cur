The text discusses HERMES, a hypermedia design environment with a language that supports a layered architecture and a variety of data retrieval, manipulation, and display needs. The language has four levels: Beginner, Advanced, Programmer, and Designer, with increasing capabilities. HERMES uses perspectives to organize information in overlapping categories, such as hierarchies of personal and group viewpoints, technical aspects, and domain traditions. Perspectives can be implemented using methods like lazy virtual copying, and can be merged and evolved. The language is non-imperative and primarily geared towards information retrieval needs. It is used to define interpretive critics, which can analyze the state of the hypermedia database and provide messages or take actions based on the results. The overall purpose of HERMES is to support a model of human interpretation as situated, perspectival, and linguistic, and to contribute to human emancipation by extending cognitive capabilities through people-centered software.
