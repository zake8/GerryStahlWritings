*****TheThings-PeterWatts.txt.faiss*****
    The text is a science fiction story titled "The Things" by Peter Watts. The story is a retelling of the 1982 film "The Thing"from the perspective of the shape-shifting alien. The alien, who refers to itself as "I," describes how it crashes on Earth and takes over the bodies of various researchers at an Antarctic base. However, it finds that the beings on this planet are very different from those it has encountered before - they are not open to communion or assimilation, and instead attack it on sight. The alien is eventually destroyed by the last remaining researcher, MacReady. The story explores themes of isolation, fear of the unknown, and the desire to communicate and understand other beings. The alien's perspective highlights the violence and hostility it faces on this planet, and its attempts to understand and communicate with the humans it encounters. The story also touches on the idea of what it means to be alive and the value of individuality versus communion. The text uses science fiction tropes to explore these themes and presents the alien's perspective through vivid and descriptive language.

Gerry Stahl's Assembled Texts:
My CV lists about 400 publications and presentations.
To organize them thematially and to make them more accessible, I have assembled the best versions of them in 21 volumes. To the extent possible, I have made these volumes available for free in electronic format (pdf, epub and mobi) and at low cost in paperback.
Most of these texts are related to issues of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), the effort to take advantage of networked digital technology to create new opportunities for students to create shared knowledge and to learn together. The most important articles on my CSCL research in the Virtual Math Teams project are presented systematically in my five academic publications (reproduced as volumes 3-6 and 19).
A guide to the eLibrary as well as an overview of my work and life is compiled in volume 18: Overview and Autobiographical Essays. 
Note that volumes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 19 were commercially published. My PDFs are not the official versions, but are pre-publication versions for informal use.
Why did I collect my writings in these volumes? As the official list of my publications approached and then exceeded two hundred distinct textual artifacts, it became difficult for me to keep track of their interrelationships. Many texts built upon previous ones in complicated ways, perhaps merging ideas from multiple sources, extending the analysis in different directions, situating common thoughts in contrasting contexts, providing updated versions or simply referencing each other.
In looking back over the titles and thinking about their contents, I realized that what I have really wanted to say with all this has still not come to word satisfactorily, perhaps because it cannot be adequately presented in the confines of a journal article or conference presentation. It seemed to me that many of my papers more or less circled a concept, which I gradually began to refer to as "group cognition." I compiled my most important writings from the decade of 1995-2005 in my first major book, "Group Cognition." When I got to read this compilation in one coherent text, I felt that the volume succeeded in saying considerably more than the sum of its individual contributions.
Fearing that the sheer number of my publications--substantially increasing every year--must cause problems for my readers, assuming that they want to grasp what I am trying to say, I therefore determined to continue to assemble fragments of my published output into meaningful and synthetic collections. The second such attempt was with "Studying Virtual Math Teams," which gathered together the most important writings as of 2009 about the research project that I directed from 2003-2012, including chapters by colleagues and international collaborators.
During the summer of 2010, I decided to explore self-publication, which brings with it many benefits for the author, the readers and the texts. For the author, it offers complete control and reduces the turn-around time from years to hours. For readers, it reduces the costs to nothing or to low print-on-demand fees, and offers multiple e-book formats. For the texts, it makes them available in multiple formats and allows them to be updated easily.
I have now published my collected writings, starting with my dissertations and then some early essays in philosophy. I tried to collect the best versions of all my academic writings that I consider worth republishing, and gathered them in volumes based on theme and chronology. They are all conveniently accessible from this site. I hope this allows readers to make better sense of the words that I have put on paper and/or on the computer screen.
I began writing as a student of philosophy. In that field, books are the traditional medium of choice. All the great philosophers have their ideas arrayed in their collected works volumes in the library stacks. In the 21st century, books seem old-fashioned; brief blogs, YouTube sound bites and even tiny tweets are preferred. But the complex issues involved in something like CSCL may require book-length treatments (or even multiple volumes). Otherwise, the educational reforms enunciated by Dewey, the collaborative learning suggested by Vygotsky and the computer support of collaboration prototyped by Engelbart would have been implemented in schools long ago.
I hope that this eLibrary allows readers to browse through my writings and follow their interests as deeply as they desire through these aggregated texts.

*****cscltheories.pdf.faiss*****
<summary text for *****cscltheories.pdf.faiss*****>
The text presents a chapter on the theories of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). CSCL is defined as a theory- and research-based pedagogical vision of collaborative learning, shaped by rapidly evolving digital technologies, pedagogical practices, and research methods. The authors categorize relevant theories into three groups: subjective (individual cognition and learning), intersubjective (interactional meaning making), and inter-objective (networks of learners, tools, artifacts, and practices). The chapter discusses the role of theory in CSCL, the changing role of theory in CSCL, major theories currently influential in the field, and their philosophical and methodological underpinnings. The framework for examining theories of CSCL includes technology, practice, and method as interrelated and mutually shaping factors. The text also discusses the history and development of CSCL technologies, practices, and methods, and how they have been influenced by subjective, intersubjective, and inter-objective theories.

*****practices.pdf.faiss*****
<summary text for *****practices.pdf.faiss*****>
The text is a journal article titled "Group practices: a new way of viewing CSCL" published in the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning in 2017. The article is written by Gerry Stahl and focuses on the importance of analyzing group practices in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) to understand how students learn collaboratively. The author argues that traditional methods of measuring changes in learning outcomes are insufficient and that CSCL needs ways to analyze group processes that bring about such changes. The author proposes a new method for CSCL that focuses on the small-group unit of analysis and the adoption of group practices by student teams. The article also discusses the theory of group practices and its implications for the design of CSCL software, curriculum, pedagogy, and experimental interventions. The document also includes references to previous research and publications by the author.
