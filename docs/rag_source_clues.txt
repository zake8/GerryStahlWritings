Gerry Stahl's Assembled Texts:
My CV lists about 400 publications and presentations.
To organize them thematially and to make them more accessible, I have assembled the best versions of them in 21 volumes. To the extent possible, I have made these volumes available for free in electronic format (pdf, epub and mobi) and at low cost in paperback.
Most of these texts are related to issues of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), the effort to take advantage of networked digital technology to create new opportunities for students to create shared knowledge and to learn together. The most important articles on my CSCL research in the Virtual Math Teams project are presented systematically in my five academic publications (reproduced as volumes 3-6 and 19).
A guide to the eLibrary as well as an overview of my work and life is compiled in volume 18: Overview and Autobiographical Essays. 
Note that volumes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 19 were commercially published. My PDFs are not the official versions, but are pre-publication versions for informal use.
Why did I collect my writings in these volumes? As the official list of my publications approached and then exceeded two hundred distinct textual artifacts, it became difficult for me to keep track of their interrelationships. Many texts built upon previous ones in complicated ways, perhaps merging ideas from multiple sources, extending the analysis in different directions, situating common thoughts in contrasting contexts, providing updated versions or simply referencing each other.
In looking back over the titles and thinking about their contents, I realized that what I have really wanted to say with all this has still not come to word satisfactorily, perhaps because it cannot be adequately presented in the confines of a journal article or conference presentation. It seemed to me that many of my papers more or less circled a concept, which I gradually began to refer to as "group cognition." I compiled my most important writings from the decade of 1995-2005 in my first major book, "Group Cognition." When I got to read this compilation in one coherent text, I felt that the volume succeeded in saying considerably more than the sum of its individual contributions.
Fearing that the sheer number of my publications--substantially increasing every year--must cause problems for my readers, assuming that they want to grasp what I am trying to say, I therefore determined to continue to assemble fragments of my published output into meaningful and synthetic collections. The second such attempt was with "Studying Virtual Math Teams," which gathered together the most important writings as of 2009 about the research project that I directed from 2003-2012, including chapters by colleagues and international collaborators.
During the summer of 2010, I decided to explore self-publication, which brings with it many benefits for the author, the readers and the texts. For the author, it offers complete control and reduces the turn-around time from years to hours. For readers, it reduces the costs to nothing or to low print-on-demand fees, and offers multiple e-book formats. For the texts, it makes them available in multiple formats and allows them to be updated easily.
I have now published my collected writings, starting with my dissertations and then some early essays in philosophy. I tried to collect the best versions of all my academic writings that I consider worth republishing, and gathered them in volumes based on theme and chronology. They are all conveniently accessible from this site. I hope this allows readers to make better sense of the words that I have put on paper and/or on the computer screen.
I began writing as a student of philosophy. In that field, books are the traditional medium of choice. All the great philosophers have their ideas arrayed in their collected works volumes in the library stacks. In the 21st century, books seem old-fashioned; brief blogs, YouTube sound bites and even tiny tweets are preferred. But the complex issues involved in something like CSCL may require book-length treatments (or even multiple volumes). Otherwise, the educational reforms enunciated by Dewey, the collaborative learning suggested by Vygotsky and the computer support of collaboration prototyped by Engelbart would have been implemented in schools long ago.
I hope that this eLibrary allows readers to browse through my writings and follow their interests as deeply as they desire through these aggregated texts.
