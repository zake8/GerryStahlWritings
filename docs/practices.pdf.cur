The text is a journal article titled "Group practices: a new way of viewing CSCL" published in the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning in 2017. The article is written by Gerry Stahl and focuses on the importance of analyzing group practices in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) to understand how students learn collaboratively. The author argues that traditional methods of measuring changes in learning outcomes are insufficient and that CSCL needs ways to analyze group processes that bring about such changes. The author proposes a new method for CSCL that focuses on the small-group unit of analysis and the adoption of group practices by student teams. The article also discusses the theory of group practices and its implications for the design of CSCL software, curriculum, pedagogy, and experimental interventions. The document also includes references to previous research and publications by the author.
