The text is a science fiction story titled "The Things" by Peter Watts, which offers a unique perspective on John Carpenter's film "The Thing." The story is presented as an account of the shapeshifting alien's thoughts and experiences during the events of the film. The alien, which refers to itself as "I," reflects on its origins, its purpose, and its interactions with the human characters in the story. It explains how it spreads by assimilating other lifeforms and how it has learned to hide and adapt to its environment. The alien has a sense of mission, believing it is a soldier at war with entropy, perfecting the universe through adaptation and communion.

Throughout the story, the alien takes on various human and dog forms, including Blair, Copper, Childs, and Palmer. It reveals that it has infiltrated the human camp and is aware of their plans to destroy it. Despite being discovered and attacked, the alien manages to escape and destroy the camp, causing the humans to unknowingly destroy themselves in the process. The story ends with the alien reflecting on its experiences and its newfound understanding of the humans' inability to change and communicate, which it finds both tragic and fascinating.

Key terms and jargon:

1. Biomass: the alien uses this term to refer to organic matter that it can assimilate and take control of.
2. Communion: the process by which the alien assimilates other lifeforms and gains access to their memories and knowledge.
3. Shapeshifting: the alien's ability to transform its appearance and take on the form of other lifeforms.
4. Adaptation: the alien's use of shapeshifting and communion to survive and thrive in various environments.
5. Entropy: a concept from thermodynamics, referring to the disorder or randomness of a system; the alien sees itself as a force fighting against entropy, constantly striving for order and improvement.
